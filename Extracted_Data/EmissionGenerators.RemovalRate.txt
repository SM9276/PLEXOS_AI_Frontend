Paragraphs:
Emission Generators Removal Rate is the proportion of emissions, produced by the Generator that are removed/scrubbed/sequestered by the Generator .

Emissions are produced when Generation occurs through the definition of one or a combination of Generators Production Rate , and by way of the Generator Fuels and/or Start Fuels memberships, the Fuels Production Rate properties. This Removal Rate is applied against both sources.

Example

Assume Generator "Steam1" uses Fuel "Coal" and that "Coal" is a producer of Emission " CO2 ".

To define the Removal Rate we put the Generator into the Emission Generators collection and set the property thus:

In this example 1 MWh of Generation uses 10 GJ of "Coal" and produces 10 Ã— 94.33 = 943.3 kg of " CO2 " but 50% of this is removed to give a net Production of 471.65 kg.
