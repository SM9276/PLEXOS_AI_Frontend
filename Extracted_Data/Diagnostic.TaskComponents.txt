Diagnostic Task Components
          toggles on/off printing to the log and screen of a detailed break down
          of the components in the mathematical programming problems solved
          during the simulation. An example of this report is:

The report is in two parts:

Each element carries a prefix that indicates the class of object such
          as "Gen" for Generator and "Nod"
          for Node , unless it is a system class
          such as "Energy". The following fields appear in the report:

The distinction between 'allocated' and 'active' is important.
          Elements are notionally allocated for all variables and constraints
          that might be required during the simulation. That is all elements
          implied by the data and settings for the active Model (not all possible elements). Some elements such as those associated
          with transmission constraints are left out of the mathematical program
          (inactive) until required. This report indicates what proportion of
          those possible elements are actually in-use at any time.

This report can be very useful in analyzing what components of your
          dataset are taking the most space in the mathematical programming
          problem. You can then focus on those aspects in improving performance.

NOTE: This diagnostic is very expensive to produce and will
          significantly slow execution of the simulation. Use it only for
          testing purposes!
