Header: Flow Control Max Voltage

Table Details:
Units:	kV
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Max Voltage

Paragraphs:
Flow Control Max Voltage is user specified voltage limits for SSSC and DSSC type of devices. The voltage limitation can be derived as extra bound for Flow Control phase angle:

Assumption is introduced here to adopt the nonlinear equation to linear programming:

Therefore, the Max Voltage input is applied as angle limits and replacing the user input Max Angle :

Please note that V nom is the nominated line voltage, which is read from Node Voltage . If Node Voltage is not defined, the Flow Control Max Voltage will be ignored.
