Paragraphs:
Gas Storage Injection Volume is the storage volume for which injection is allowed in that given band. Further injections into the storage causing the volume to rise above this value takes the simulation into the next band. The value Injection Volume corresponds with the Injection Rate Scalar value for each band.

When Use Additive Ratchet is Yes, the input needs to be incremental, starting from the last band to the first. Consider the following gas storage injection ratchet:

This defines a 1000 TJ Gas Storage with three injection bands. Band 1 has a volume of 400 TJ and can be injected into at a rate of (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2) * 100 TJ per time period. Band 2 has a volume of 300 TJ and can be injected into at a rate of (0.3 + 0.2) * 100 TJ per time period after band 1 has been filled. Lastly, band 3 has a volume of 300 TJ and can be injected into at a rate of 0.2 * 100 TJ per time period, after bands 1 and 2 have been filled.
