Header: Line Flow Non-anticipativity Time

Table Details:
Units:	h
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Key Property:	No
Description:	Window of time over which to enforce non-anticipativity constraints in scenario-wise decomposition

Paragraphs:
Line Flow Non-anticipativity Time sets the time frame over which flows on the Line are non-anticipative decisions in a stochastic optimization. This property must be used in conjunction with Flow Non-anticipativity .
