Paragraphs:
Facility Project Start Date is
          date at which units can be built by LT
            Plan . The User Interface allows entry of this property using
          normal date entries, however the value is stored internally as an
          integer being a date in Microsoft date, which is the number of days
          since 1/01/1900 (January 1, 1900). The default value of 36526 is the
          date 1/01/2000.

No units can be added before the year 2035 (date number 49310) in the
          above example.

TIP : To work out the date number
            that applies to a given date, enter the date into a cell in
            Microsoft Excel and change the number format of the cell to
            "General". This will then show the date its underlying number
            representation. The following table gives the date codes for
          various years.
