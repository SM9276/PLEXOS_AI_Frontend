Description:	Price for violating non-anticipativity constraints in scenario-wise decomposition mode

Paragraphs:
Gas Storage Trajectory Non-anticipativity is Price for violating non-anticipativity constraints in scenario-wise decomposition mode.

This property can be defined in combination with Trajectory Non-anticipativity Volume to define a multi-band function.

Please see the Trajectory Nonanticipativity help article for an example of this property.
