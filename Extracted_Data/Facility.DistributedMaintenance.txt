Paragraphs:
Facility Distributed Maintenance
          is an output of the PASA simulation
          phase. It represents the 'idealized' maintenance profile for the Facility assuming that any amount of capacity from zero to Max
            Operating Level can be scheduled at any time. This idealized
          profile is input to the calculations for the maintenance events for
          the Facility . The modeled
          maintenance events are reported during MT
            Schedule and ST Schedule with the Maintenance property.
