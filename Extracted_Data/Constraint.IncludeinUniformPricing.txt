Header: Constraint Include in Uniform Pricing

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Key Property:	No
Description:	If the constraint is enforced in the unconstrained phase of uniform pricing.

Paragraphs:
Constraint Include in Uniform Pricing switches the constraint in and out of the unconstrained (market price setting) run of the uniform pricing simulation. By default all user-defined constraints are relaxed in the unconstrained run, thus you need to set this property to true (-1) for each constraint you want included in the unconstrained run.The flag can take these values:

The value of this property cannot be changed during the simulation itself, i.e. it cannot be used to toggle the constraint in and out of the specific simulation phase.
