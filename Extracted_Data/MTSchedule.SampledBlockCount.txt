Header: MT Schedule Sampled Block Count

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Description:	Number of blocks modeled in each sample period (day/week) where zero means the original number of intervals

Paragraphs:
LT Plan Sampled Block Count applies when the Chronology setting is "Sampled". By default each sample period
          (day/week/month) is modeled at the resolution set by Horizon Periods per Day (24 periods
          per day, or "hourly" by default). This parameter is used to reduce the
          number of modeled simulation periods. The reduction in performed using
          the same approach as for Fitted Chronology i.e. a curve fit is performed to the specified system profile - see
          the Chronology topic for
          details.
