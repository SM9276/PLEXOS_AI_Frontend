Description:	Minimum number of units automatically retired in aggregate over the planning horizon

Paragraphs:
Generator Min Units Retired is sets a lower bound on the number of units automatically retired in LT Plan . 
            This bound is applied either at the end of the horizon (static input) or throughout the horizon (dynamic input) as follows:

Static input (one value over the horizon, i.e. no Date To, Date From): the lower bound is applied to the last capacity optimisation period of the last step.
                    The given number of units are retired in aggregate by the end of the planning horizon. Dynamic input (different values over the horizon, e.g. via Date To/Date From): the lower bound on retirements is applied to every capacity optimisation 
                    period ( LT Plan Discount Period i.e. year).
