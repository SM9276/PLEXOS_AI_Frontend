Key Property:	No
Description:	Number of units producing heat

Paragraphs:
This is the number of units producing heat i.e. that are on-line and generating heat. A unit is counted as being 'online' once it has been started and is generating above notional zero level i.e. this includes any run up/down period.

By default, he simulation will freely choose the initial commitment state of the units on/off depending on which is optimal.

Units Producing Heat will be a value between zero and the number of Units plus any Units Built (in LT Plan ). It will be an integer only if:

In all other cases Units Producing Heat can be non-integer.
