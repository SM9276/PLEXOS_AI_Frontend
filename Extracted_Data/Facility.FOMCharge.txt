Paragraphs:
Facility FO&M Charge is the
          fixed operations and maintenance charge for each installed unit at the
          facility.

The charge is defined on a per-year basis, thus the total FO&M
          Cost for a unit in a year is defined as:

FO&M
            Cost = Installed
            Capacity x FO&M Charge

The tax rate is taken into account if Depreciation
            Method is set so that:

FO&M Charge (modeled) =
          FO&M Charge x (1 - Tax Rate ).

This charge is combined with the Build
            Cost in the objective function of LT
            Plan . The cost is also relevant for retirement candidates (as an avoidable cost).

Fixed costs are only counted against a Facility's Installed
            Capacity i.e. Facilities with zero Units or zero Units Built do not
          incur fixed costs. The total fixed operations and maintenance cost
          incurred is reported in the FO&M
            Cost property.
