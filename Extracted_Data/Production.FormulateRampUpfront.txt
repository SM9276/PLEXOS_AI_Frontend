Header: Production Formulate Ramp Upfront

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	True (-1)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	If ramp constraints should all be formulated upfront rather than checked iteratively.

Paragraphs:
Production Formulate Ramp Upfront determines how Generator ramping constraints (defined by Max Ramp Up and/or Max Ramp Down ) are enforced in the mathematical programming problem. This setting can take the following values:

The former option does not require iterations of solutions to solve, and latter will result in iterations but a smaller problem size in general. You should test both settings and compare solution times. Use the method that results in the best solution times.
