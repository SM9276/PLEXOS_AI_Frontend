Default Value:	1
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Description:	Number of years modeled after the end of branching in each rolling iteration

Paragraphs:
This option applies to models with a scenario tree solved using Stochastic
            Algorithm = "Rolling Horizon". Please refer to Multi-stage
            Stochastic Optimization for more information on solving models
          with scenarios trees. At each iteration, branching will occur for a
          number of stages (weeks or months) as determined by the Minimum
            Sample Weight and/or Rolling
            Stage Increment . The horizon is modeled in detail during the
          branching stages and then in a more aggregated way afterwards. This
          option is the number of years modeled after the end of
          branching.Â  By default modeling continues for one year after
          branching stops. After this point the optimization has no further view
          of the future.

Increasing the lookahead can improve the solution but at the cost of
          longer runtime and potential numerical issues.

This option has no effect on the final deterministic iteration of
          Rolling Horizon.
