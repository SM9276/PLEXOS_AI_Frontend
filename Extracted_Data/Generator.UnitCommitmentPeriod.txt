Paragraphs:
Generator Unit Commitment Period
          sets the resolution, in hours, for unit commitment (on/off) decisions
          as opposed to the production/dispatch decisions. The default value of
          zero means that unit commitment is performed at the same resolution as
          production/dispatch. Reducing the resolution for unit commitment will
          reduce the complexity of the unit commitment problem and might improve
          solution times. The setting is particularly useful when running very
          high resolution simulations e.g. where the dispatch interval is a few
          minutes or seconds.

For example, you might want to select for certain generators to
          commit on an hourly basis while the dispatch is 5 minutes; or in an
          hourly simulation you might want some larger generator to commit every
          three hours, etc.
