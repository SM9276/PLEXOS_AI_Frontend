Table Details:
Units:	pu
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Min Impedance

Paragraphs:
Flow Control Min Impedance is user specified Impedance limits for DSR, TCSC and MSSR type of devices. The Impedance limitation can be derived as a function of line flow:

Therefore, the Min Impedance input is applied as flow/angle limits and replacing the user input Max Angle .Note that Min Impedance must be smaller than or equal to Max Impedance.
