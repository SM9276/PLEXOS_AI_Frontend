Paragraphs:
Generator Efficiency Incr is the
          incremental efficiency of hydro generation. It is combined with Load
            Point in multiple bands to define an efficiency function across
          the range of generation. The 'no-load efficiency' is defined using Efficiency Base .

Example ( using metric units ) The purpose
          of this example is to show you how PLEXOS calculates Efficiency by
          given table 1. Picture 1, 2 and 4 is the process result of
          calculation.

Example ( using imperial US units )
