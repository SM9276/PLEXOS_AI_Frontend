Paragraphs:
Gas Demand Shortage Price is the notional price of shortage when supply is not sufficient to meet the Demand . 
            Multiple bands can be used in conjunction with the Shortage Level input to specify tiered pricing. In this case, the Shortage Price 
            should be increasing from the lower to upper bands. Gas Demand Shortage Price is a very critical input when designing electric-gas cooptimized models. In case P2X element is converting electricity
            to gas, the Gas Demand Shortage Price should be smaller than the VoLL on the electricity node. In case gas is being supplied to a generator that is generating electricity, the shortage price of Gas Demand should be higher
            than the VoLL on electric side.

In output, the required Shortage is reported along with the Hours of Shortage and Shortage Cost .
