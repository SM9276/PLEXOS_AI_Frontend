Paragraphs:
Line Loss Incr is the linear (first-order) term in the equation that defines losses for flows in the reference direction.

This value applies in the counter-reference direction if Loss Incr  Back is not defined.

NOTE : Loss Incr and Loss Incr Back multiply the Flow with positive numbers in the reference direction and negative numbers in the counter-reference direction i.e. :

For Flow in the reference direction (positive flows):

and for the counter-reference direction (negative flows):

Thus when using Loss Incr and/or Loss Incr Back alone to define a single linear loss function Loss Incr should be a positive number and Loss Incr Back a negative number. For  quadratic loss equations however, these properties could be either sign.

Example

The following input defines the loss function and associated Marginal Loss Factor shown in Figure 1.



If we now linearize the above quadratic taking the average negative flow as one function and the average positive flow as the second function.
