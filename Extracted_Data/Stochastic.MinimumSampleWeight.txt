Paragraphs:
Stochastic Minimum Sample Weight
          applies to the Rolling Horizon algorithm for solving multi-stage
          stochastic optimization - see MT
            Schedule Stochastic
            Algorithm . It is a tolerance used to determine how many stages
          should be included in one rolling step in rolling horizon. Generally,
          at each node in the Scenario tree, the branches (Full or Hanging) are
          assumed to have uniform weights. The last stage in one rolling step is
          the one which has probabilities(weights) below this tolerance, no more
          hanging branches are created after this stage.

The number of branching stages calculated based on this parameter
          can  be overridden with the Rolling
            Stage Increment setting.
