Description:	Ratio that converts energy ramping to units comparable to reserve ramping units

Paragraphs:
Reserve Batteries Response Ratio is the ratio that converts energy ramping to units
          comparable to reserve ramping units. Response Ratio defines the ratio
          at which the battery can provide reserve in proportion to its ramping
          capabilities. It has to be defined along with Reserve Time Frame and
          battery's ramp limits (ie. Max Ramp Up and Max Ramp Down). Response
          Ratio has a direct impact on both battery's ramping limits and reserve
          response. They are mutually exclusive, which means that if the battery
          is ramping up/down in consecutive periods, it should limit the
          response reserve in proportion to the Response Ratio value. See also Reserve Generators
            Response Ratio for more details.
