Paragraphs:
Competition Start Cost Mark-up
          is a flag that indicates if generator
            mark-ups should be automatically set such that one start
            cost is recovered within the Start
            Cost Mark-up Window which by default is 24 hours.

Start cost recovery is achieved by the addition to the formulation of
          a set of mark-up 'bands' across the total production of the generator
          in each recovery window. The number of bands is controlled by the Start Cost
            Mark-up Production Bands setting. Each band has associated with
          it a unique mark-up which would be required to recover the start cost.
          Integer variables are added to the formulation to activate the
          appropriate mark-up band when a start occurs and as a function of
          total Generation in the
          window.

Note that these mark-up bands are only applied if a start actually
          occurs in the window, and if more than one start occurs, the mark-ups
          only account for one start cost.

The final start cost mark-up applied is included in the reported
          properties Generator Mark-up and Offer Price .
