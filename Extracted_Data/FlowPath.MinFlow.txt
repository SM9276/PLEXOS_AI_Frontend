Paragraphs:
Flow Path Min Flow is the negative of the maximum flow in any interval on the Flow Path in the
          notional backward direction i.e. from the Flow
            Node To to the Flow Node
            From . You can also limit the flow by Hour , Day , Week , Month or Year .

For the example in Table 1, the Flow Path is bi-directional with flow
          on 1000 allowed in either direction.

Note that positive values of Min Flow are allowed, and imply that a
          minimum amount of flow must occur in the notional forward direction.
