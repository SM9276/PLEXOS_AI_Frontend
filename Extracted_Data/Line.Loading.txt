Description:	Loading relative to thermal limit.

Paragraphs:
Line Line loading is the flow on the line relative to the export/import limit. In the period solution data it is defined as follows:

If the line flow is greater than or equal to zero ( Flow >= 0 ): Loading = 100 × Flow / Export Limit.

Otherwise: Loading = 100 × Flow / Import Limit.

In summary, it is the flow with respect to the reference direction. Note: The line loading does not necessarily reflect thermal constraints on the line if there are custom constraints in place.
