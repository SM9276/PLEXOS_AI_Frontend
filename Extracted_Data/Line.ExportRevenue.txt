Paragraphs:
Line Export Revenue is the revenue from energy exported. It is a component of Rental when the Transmission Rental Method = "Point to Point" and is calculated as:

Please note that the loss component in above equation is only considered when transmission loss modelling is enabled.

The revenues are considering the price paid at the "reception" node for the energy received (energy transported minus losses in the reception point) When the line is importing , the energy flows from Node To to Node From. Therefore, Import Revenue = Flow × Price @ Node From When the line is exporting , the energy flows from the Node From to the Node To. Therefore, Export Revenue = Flow × Price @ Node To
