Paragraphs:
Generator Ramp Down is the total
          ramping down in the period, and is defined as:

Ramp Down = MAX (0, Generation ( t -1) - Generation t )

where: t indexes periods of the
            simulation. The t =0 value of Generation refers to the
            previous simulation step and for step one it is set with the Initial
              Generation property.

This is distinct from Ramp which
          reports the ramping rate in megawatts per minute.Ramp Down
          can be used in combination with Minutes
            of Ramp Down to determine the intensity of ramping down over any
          period.
