Description:	Coefficient of spill in the condition equation

Paragraphs:
This is the coefficient of Storage Spill in the Variable condition equation.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the left-hand side of the condition equation:

… + a (i,j) × Storage Spill … {<,≤,
            ≥,>, =} Profile

Note that the left-hand side of the equation is available in the
          property Variable Activity .
