Paragraphs:
Generator Initial Generation sets
          the initial ( t =0) dispatch state of the facility. It is used
          to initialize constraints such as Max
            Ramp Up , Max Ramp Down , Min Up Time , Min
            Down Time , Max Up Time ,
          and Max Down Time . This
          property is combined with Initial
            Units Generating and Initial
            Hours Up or Initial
            Hours Down when enforcing minimum/maximum up and down time
          constraints. If you omit Initial
            Units Generating then it is assumed that, if initial generation
          is non-zero, all available units are running, otherwise if Initial
          Generation is zero then all units are off at t =0.

If Initial Generation is not defined then the initial dispatch state
          is freely optimized i.e. a value is determined by the
          optimization that minimizes the impact of the initial conditions on
          the overall system cost.



In the example in Table 1 the operating state at t =0 is one
          unit operating at 500 MW. Because the maximum ramp is 2 MW/min. the
          unit can reach a maximum of 470 MW (350 + 2 x 60) or minimum of 230 MW
          (350 - 2 x 60) in the first hour. Additionally, the unit has been up
          for six hours and must continue operating for a further 12 to meet the
          minimum up time.
