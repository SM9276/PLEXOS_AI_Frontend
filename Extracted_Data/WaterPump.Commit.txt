Table Details:
Units:	-
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	-1
Validation Rule:	â‰¥-1
Key Property:	No
Description:	Number of units that should be committed

Paragraphs:
WaterPump Commit predetermines or
          'hardwires' the unit commitment either in all periods or selected
          periods. Commit specifies the number of units that (if available)
          should be committed. A value of -1 for any period means the unit
          commitment is to be optimized in the usual way. It is acceptable to
          mix -1 with non-negative values if you wish to set the commitment
          pattern only in certain time periods.

As with any property its value can change by date and pattern and
          scenario, and even be read from a flat text file. Note that any
          non-negative value of Commit is hard constraint e.g. a value of zero
          means no units are allowed to be committed. If you want to set a
          minimum unit commitment instead of a fixed commitment, use the Must
            Run Units property.

Water Pumps with the Commit property defined require less unit
          commitment overhead in the optimization. This provides the simulation
          with a significant computational boost, and hence it is desirable to
          set this for all 'baseload' water pumps, or other water pumps with fixed
          or semi-fixed commitment schedules. Commit is ignored when a unit is
          out of service so there is no need to account for outages when
          defining the property. Note however that Commit overrides other
          constraints such as Min Down
            Time and Min Up Time i.e. if you define Commit = 1 a unit will be committed if available
          regardless of whether or not Min
            Down Time gets violated and vice versa for Min
            Up Time .
