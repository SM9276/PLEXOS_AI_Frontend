Key Property:	No
Description:	Maximum change in flow (MW or cumecs per hour)

Paragraphs:
Waterway Max Ramp is the maximum change in flow (MW or cumecs per hour). To correctly enforce the constraint in the initial (t=0) period of a chronological simulation ( e.g. ST Schedule ) you should also define Initial Flow . In the absence of this definition the t=0 ramp constraint is relaxed. This constraint can be made a soft constraint with the Max Ramp Penalty property.
