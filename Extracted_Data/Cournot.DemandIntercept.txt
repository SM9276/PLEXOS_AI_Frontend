Header: Cournot Demand Intercept

Table Details:
Units:	$/MWh
Mode:	Input/Output
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Key Property:	No
Description:	Demand function vertical intercept
A	Demand Intercept	250	$/MWh
A	Demand Slope	-0.02	$/MWh/MWh

Paragraphs:
This is the demand function intercept for use in Nash-Cournot game.

The demand function is linear function with intercept in units of price ( e.g. $/ MWh ). The higher the intercept relative to the Demand Slope , the less elastic the demand function.

Example

As an output this is the demand function intercept used in the Nash-Cournot game. If defined as input this is simply a repeat of that input, otherwise it is the intercept computed based on the Elasticity assumed.
