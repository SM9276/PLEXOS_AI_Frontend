Paragraphs:
Global Tree Stages Leaves relates to
          the Scenario Tree and sets the number of leaves (nodes) at in each
          stage in the tree.

You have two options when defining the tree depending on its
          complexity:

Note that if you are using Hanging
            Branches , this property sets only the number of full branches at
          each stage. If using the traditional scenario tree, the value for the
          last stage is not required.

For example in Table 1 the Stochastic Risk Sample Count is 12
          and a 4-stage Scenario Tree is constructed with the tree as
          illustrated in Figure 1.
