Paragraphs:
Performance Feasibility
          Tolerance is a solver setting for the simplex optimizer. The default
          of zero means the solver's default feasibility tolerance will be used,
          which is generally 1e-6. Values above zero will be passed to the
          solver.

The feasibility tolerance is the degree to which values of the basic
          variables calculated by the simplex method may violate their bounds.
          The solver does not use this tolerance to relax the variable bounds
          nor to relax right hand side values. This parameter specifies an
          allowable violation. Feasibility influences the selection of an
          optimal basis and can be reset to a higher value when a problem is
          having difficulty maintaining feasibility during optimization. You can
          also lower this tolerance after finding an optimal solution if there
          is any doubt that the solution is truly optimal. If the feasibility
          tolerance is set too low, the solver may falsely conclude that a
          problem is infeasible. If you encounter reports of unrepairable
          infeasibility with a small violation, a small adjustment in the
          feasibility tolerance may improve performance.
