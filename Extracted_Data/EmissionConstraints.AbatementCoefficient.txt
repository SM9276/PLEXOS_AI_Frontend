Paragraphs:
Emission Constraints Abatement Coefficient sets the left-hand side term for Emission Abatement in the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following term is added to the formulation:

By default, this sum is taken over all Generators producing the Emission . However you can limit the set of Generators included in the sum by adding Emission Companies memberships with no associated property definitions> only the emissions of those Companies will then be included. This is a special case of using 'null' memberships to filter the terms included in another constraint property.
