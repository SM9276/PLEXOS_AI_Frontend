Default Value:	1
Validation Rule:	In (0,1)
Description:	The basis for capacity-related properties where "Input" refers to the Primary Input and "Output" refers to the Primary Output

Paragraphs:
Facility Capacity Basis determines
          what Unit the capacity-related
          properties of the Facility are in. It can take the following values:

This setting affects capacity-related properties such as:

For example, a facility using electricity ( Primary
            Process Primary Input )
          to synthesize NH 3 from H 2 and N 2 would have capacity quoted in
          megawatts of electric load and therefore Capacity Basis should be
          "Input". Conversely an electricity generating station has capacity
          quoted in megawatts of electric output and therefore Capacity Basis
          should be "Output".

For the "Input" case, properties such as Max
            Operating Level are converted to "Output" style by the
          simulation engine using the nominal Process Efficiency and Conversion
            Factor and all internal calculations occur on an "Output" basis
          with reporting values scaled back again to report on an "Input" basis.
