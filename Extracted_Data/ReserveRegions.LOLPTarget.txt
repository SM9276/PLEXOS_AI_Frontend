Description:	Loss of Load Probability target for this region

Paragraphs:
Reserve Regions LOLP Target sets a upper bound on the Loss of Load Probability (for
          each dispatch period) in the Region specified in the membership in ST Schedule . The unit commitment
          will attempt to meet the required LOLP Target by making decision of
          the amount of spinning reserve. The constraint is only statistically
          satisfied, i.e., the LOLP in the solution can be a little higher or
          lower than the set target in the region.

The formula for the LOLP constraint, which is integrated into the
          unit commitment optimization, can be written as:

where t : index of the dispatch period, i : index
          of the generating unit, SR : total spinning reserve, U : generating unit commitment, C : coefficient of the LOLP
          constraint.

The coefficient C is calculated for all generators (with FORs ) in each period based on the capacity
          and forced outage rate of all generation units as well as the user
          provided LOLP target. Since the constraint actually uses the provided
          LOLP criterion to determine the optimum spinning reserve during the
          unit commitment, both the spinning reserve and the unit commitment are
          required in the optimization model which is, therefore, an MIP
          problem.

It should be noted that the constraint might not be accurate in some
          cases, such as very small systems (e.g., the number of generating
          units in service < 20; notice that generators with zero Forced
          Outage Rate are not included in the calculation of the LOLP constraint
          coefficients) and systems having a few large units or having large
          share of units with high forced outage rates. Also, the constraint is
          only suitable for small LOLP values, e.g., less than 10%; for larger
          LOLP values, the accuracy is not guaranteed.
