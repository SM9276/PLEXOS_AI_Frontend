Paragraphs:
Region Constraints Generation Capacity Retired Coefficient is the left-hand side
          coefficient of the total Region Generators Capacity Retired from the
          start of the horizon up to the current period in the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation.
