Paragraphs:
Charging Station Lower
          Reserve is the provision of lower ('spin down') reserve summed over
          all lower reserve types (lower and
          regulation lower). Lower reserve is provided by reserving some Charging capability to the Vehicle batteries when the SoC is below Max SoC or by offering to
          reduce Discharging from the battery. This is allowed only when the Max
            Discharge Rate is non-zero.
