Table Details:
Units:	MW/MW
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Coefficient of generator efficiency

Paragraphs:
This is the coefficient of Generator Efficiency in the Variable condition equation. The value accounts for the current level of head
                if head effects are modeled.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
                term is added to the left-hand side of the condition equation:

… + a (i,j) × Generator Efficiency … {<,≤,
                    ≥,>, =} Profile

Note that the left-hand side of the equation is available in the
                property Variable Activity and this value can be used not only as a condition test but also to
                modify other input properties via the Action and Expression fields in
                the data grid, thus allowing you to multiply two input properties.
