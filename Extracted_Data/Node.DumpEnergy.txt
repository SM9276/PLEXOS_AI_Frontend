Header: Node Dump Energy

Table Details:
Units:	MW
Mode:	Output Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	
Validation Rule:	
Key Property:	No
Description:	Dump energy

Paragraphs:
Node Dump Energy is the amount of
          over-generation at the node due to a lack of transmission capacity out
          of the node and constraints on generation at the node that are forcing
          certain levels of generation.

Although this is not a physically feasible outcome this variable is
          useful when diagnosing problems with a transmission network's set up
          or to identify when there is a lack of flexibility in the generation
          system e.g. an excess of renewable generation defined with Fixed Load .

You can toggle on/off modelling of dump energy using the Transmission Allow Dump Energy property. You can further refine this setting using the Node Allow Dump Energy property.
