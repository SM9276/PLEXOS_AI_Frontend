Paragraphs:
Facility Max Ramp Up sets a limit on the amount that Production can increase in any given interval. The value is the maximum change in
          production per hour. This limit applies for Production ranges between the minimum
            operating level and Max
            Operating Level .

By default the ramping limit is a hard constraint meaning that no
          violation is allowed. To create soft constraints with a penalty price
          use the Max Ramp Up Penalty property.
