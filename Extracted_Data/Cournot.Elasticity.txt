Paragraphs:
Cournot Elasticity reports the price elasticity of demand associated with the demand curve used in the Nash-Cournot game.

In the case where both Demand Intercept and Demand Slope are defined, the elasticity is computed as a point elasticity:

In other words, it is equal to the first derivative of quantity with respect to price (∂Qd/∂P) multiplied by the point's price (P c ) divided by its quantity (Q c ).

If the demand function parameters are not defined, then Elasticity reports either the Default Elasticity or Elasticity (if defined).
