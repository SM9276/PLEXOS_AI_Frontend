Paragraphs:
Gas Plant Start Penalty is a
          penalty applied to starting a unit that is additional to the normal Start Cost but is not included
          in the reported Start
            & Shutdown Cost . This penalty can be used to affect the
          optimal unit commitment by either increasing or decreasing a unit's
          apparent start cost while not affecting the reported costs.
