Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Ramp Down Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of Generator Ramp in the downward direction in
          the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the
          following term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × Generator MAX(0, - Ramp ) ... {≤,
            ≥, =} b j
