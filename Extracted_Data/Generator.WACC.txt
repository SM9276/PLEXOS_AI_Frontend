Paragraphs:
Generator WACC is the
          weighted-average cost of capital for the project.

WACC is used  in combination with Economic
            Life in LT Plan to compute the
          stream of annuities equivalent to the defined Build
            Cost . If no WACC rate is set, the discount
            rate is used.

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a
          company is expected to pay to finance its assets. WACC is the minimum
          return that a company must earn on its existing asset base to satisfy
          its creditors, owners, and other providers of capital. Companies raise
          money from a number of sources: common equity, preferred equity,
          straight debt, convertible debt, exchangeable debt, warrants, options,
          pension liabilities, executive stock options, governmental subsidies,
          and so on. Different securities are expected to generate different
          returns. WACC is calculated taking into account the relative weights
          of each component of the capital structure.
