Paragraphs:
Flow Control Angle Points is used to define multi-band Flow Control Angles with Flow Control Flow Loading Points . A piece-wise linear curve can be defined with those two properties, given a fixed angle-flow function. The Angle Points is always decreasing with increasing Flow Loading Points , because of the operating principles.

Example:

Properties shown in above table will define a piece-wise linear angle-flow curve as below:
