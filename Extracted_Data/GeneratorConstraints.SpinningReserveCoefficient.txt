Description:	Coefficient of reserve provided by spare capacity

Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Spinning Reserve Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient on the
          spinning reserve provided by the generator in the constraint. This
          excludes reserve provided by off-line capacity, synchronous condenser
          operation or dispatchable pump load or regulation reserve i.e. it applies only to the provision of Reserve Type = "Raise", "Lower" or
          "Operational".

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

where:

You can limit the set of Reserves included in this sum by adding Generator Reserves memberships with no
          associated property definitions. This is a special case of using
          'null' memberships to filter the terms included in another constraint
          property.
