Paragraphs:
Gas Storage Withdrawal Rate Scalar scales the Withdrawal Ratchet to set an upper bound on the maximum amount of gas that can be withdrawn from the storage within a particular time period and band. This value corresponds with the Withdrawal Volume (or Withdrawal Volume Factor if using percentage based ratchets) for the given band.

When Use Additive Ratchet is Yes, the input is incremental, starting from the last band to the first. For example:

In this case, band 1, which has a volume of 400 TJ, can be withdrawn from at a rate of (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2) * 100 TJ per time period. Band 2, which has a volume of 300 TJ, can be withdrawn from at a rate of (0.3 + 0.2) * 100 TJ per time period, after band 1 has been depleted. Lastly, band 3, which has a volume of 300 TJ, can be withdrawn from at a rate of 0.2 * 100 TJ per time period, after bands 1 and 2 have been depleted.
