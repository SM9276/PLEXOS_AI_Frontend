Paragraphs:
Flow Node Max Flow Hour sets an
          upper bound on the Flow through the
          node in each hour of the simulation. This variant only applies to
          sub-hourly models i.e. where Horizon Periods per Day is greater
          than 24. See Max Flow for more
          details.
