Description:	Minimum tranche size in fuel function piecewise linear approximation

Paragraphs:
Production Min Heat Rate Tranche
          Size works in combination with Max
            Heat Rate Tranches to limit the number of tranches used in the
          piecewise linear approximation to Facility and Generator efficiency functions
          (heat rate curves). Tranches are fitted up to Max
            Heat Rate Tranches but only to the point that the smallest is at
          least this minimum value in size.

For example, if you set Max
            Heat Rate Tranches = 10 and Min Heat Rate Tranche Size = 20 and
          a Generator has Max Capacity = 100 and Min Stable Level = 20 then with all 10 tranches in use the first would be 20
          representing Min Stable Level with the remainder being (100 - 20)/9 = 8.89 in size. Therefore the
          tranche count will be automatically reduced to 5 with tranche sizes 20
          (tranche 1) and 20 (tranches 2-5).
