Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	True (-1)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	Toggles on/off solver problem scaling

Paragraphs:
This option toggles on/off use of problem scaling by the solver.
          Problem scaling generally makes the problem more numerically robust.
          Scaling should be left on for most applications, however turning it
          off can speed up the SDDP algorithm which solves many small problems in parallel.
