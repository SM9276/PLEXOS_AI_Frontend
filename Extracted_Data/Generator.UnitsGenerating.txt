Description:	Number of units generating

Paragraphs:
This is the number of units generating i.e. that are
          on-line and operating. A unit is counted as being 'online' once it has
          been started and is generating above notional zero level i.e. this includes any run up/down period.

For short-term modeling you can set the number of units generating in
          the period immediately preceding the start of the simulation ( t =0)
          using the property Initial
            Units Generating , otherwise the optimization will freely choose
          the initial commitment state of the units on/off depending on which is
          best in terms of overall system cost.

Units Generating will be a value between zero and the number of Units plus any Units Built (in LT Plan ) less any Units
            Out .

Integer values of Units Generating i.e. integer unit commitment is
          enforced if:
