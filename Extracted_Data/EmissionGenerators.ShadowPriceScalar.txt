Description:	Scalar on the incremental cost of generation for this emission

Paragraphs:
Emission Generators Shadow Price Scalar is a multiplier on the incremental cost of generation for this Emission and Generator .

The default value of unity means that Generator incremental cost ( SRMC ) includes the cost of emissions based on the defined production rates. A value of zero can be used to remove the impact of emissions costs on the dispatch solution for the Generator . The inclusion of Shadow Price Scalar will affect the costs in the optimization, but not the reported accounting costs related to this Emission or Generator.

Note that from 7.6 version, the Shadow Price Scalar will be also applied on the incremental-emission-cost part of the OfferPrice
