Paragraphs:
Generator Must Pump Units, for a pumped storage generator ,
          defines the number of units that must pump. The number of units
          available for pumping is defined by Pump
            Units , which in turn must be no more than the total number of Units . If units are out of service
          this constraint is automatically relaxed.

This property is typically used to define a period of time when
          pumping must occur or is required to happen as in the following
          example where pumping will happen between the hours of 3:00am and
          6:00am every day:
