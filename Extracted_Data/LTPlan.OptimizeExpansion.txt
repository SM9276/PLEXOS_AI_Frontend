Header: LT Plan Optimize Expansion

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	True (-1)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	If expansion is optimized by this simulation phase

Paragraphs:
By default, LT Plan will optimize
          expansion for any resource defining the necessary expansion properties e.g. Generator Max
            Units Built . However, LT Plan may be used to bridge (decompose) constraints or storage only and ignore
          the expansion optimization, making the simulation phase similar to MT Schedule .
