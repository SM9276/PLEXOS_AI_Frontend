Header: Zone Peak Load

Table Details:
Units:	MW
Mode:	Output Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	
Validation Rule:	
Key Property:	No
Description:	Peak load across the current period

Paragraphs:
Zone Peak Load is the maximum value of input Load across all intervals in the period.

For example, if Partial Chronology maps three intervals with loads 10MW, 20MW and 30MW to a single LDC, the block
            Peak Load is 30MW. In Full Chronology ST Schedule , each interval is modelled directly, so the input Zone Load is summed over all bands and reflected in this property.
