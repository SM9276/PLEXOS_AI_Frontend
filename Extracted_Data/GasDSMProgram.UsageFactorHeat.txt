Key Property:	No
Description:	Scalar heat value regardless of demand

Paragraphs:
Gas DSM Program Usage Factor Heat is multi-band scalar which denotes energy usage per unit of heat value for one customer. For each Gas Demand attached to the DSM Program, Temperature (or Heating Degree Days ) data that falls within a Usage Factor Heat Point band will be multiplied by the corresponding Usage Factor Heat value for that band.
                This value is aggregated to calculate max demand reduction for expansion and regular DSM programs.
