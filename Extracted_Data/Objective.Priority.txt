Description:	Priority of the objective when doing hierarchical multi-objective optimization

Paragraphs:
Objective Priority determines the
          order in which objectives are solved when doing hierarchical
          multi-objective optimization. Higher priority objectives (those with a
          higher value of Priority) are solved first. The default objective
          function's priority is controlled with the Model Objective Priority property. By default that objective has priority 1 and any user
          defined objective has priority 0 thus user-defined objectives are
          solved after the default objective. To change this ordering you can
          modify the Model priority and Objective Priority to obtain the order
          desired.
