Paragraphs:
Vehicle Purchase Cost is the
              cost of purchasing a new Vehicle for LT
                Plan . This cost can be defined in combination with Economic
                Life and WACC so
              that LT Plan computes an annuity
              as described in the article LT Plan .
              If Purchase Cost is defined without these parameters then the
              entire cost is incurred in the period the Vehicle is added.

As output Purchase Cost is the total cost of vehicles purchased
              in the reporting period.
