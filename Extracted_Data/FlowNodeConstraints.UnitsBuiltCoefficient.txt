Paragraphs:
Flow Node Constraints Units Built Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of the Units
            Built in the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × Flow
            Node Units Built ... {≤, ≥, =} b j
