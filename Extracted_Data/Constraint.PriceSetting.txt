Paragraphs:
Constraint Price Setting applies
          when a penalty function is
          defined on the Constraint. It indicates if the penalty function can
          set price i.e. that the marginal Penalty
            Price can propagate through to pricing of commodities. When
          toggled off, a second 'pricing' optimization is solved where the Violation is fixed and priced at zero.
