Paragraphs:
Market Price can be used alone
              to set an inelastic price i.e. price does not vary with
              quantity purchased or sold, or alternatively defined with multiple
              bands in combination with Quantity and Base Quantity to
              define a market supply/demand curve for a market with depth.

The actual price paid / received in the market is:

Price (output) = Price (input) Ã— Price
                Scalar + Price Incr + spread

where: spread adjusts for any
                defined Bid-Ask Spread

When a Market is connected to a Gas Node and the dataset's Base Unit Setting is Metric 
			- then when upgrading from earlier PLEXOS versions to version 10 
			- the manually inputted price will be divided by a 1000 since the metric gas model uses TJ for Quantity and $/GJ for Price. 
			This scaling is not applied to the values coming from the datafile.
