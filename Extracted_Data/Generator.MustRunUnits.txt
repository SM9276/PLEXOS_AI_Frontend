Paragraphs:
Generator Must Run Units is the
          number of units at the facility that must be committed i.e. a lower
          bound on Units Generating .
          The optimizer is free to commit more than this number of units up to Available Units . In the LT Plan, if the input value of Must Run Units is more than the existing number of units, then 
			the Must Run Units will be capped to the existing number of units.

Note that if you want a fixed commitment, rather than a minimum
          commitment, then use the Commit property. Please note that if Must Run Units is set equal to Units the property
          is converted to Commit automatically.
