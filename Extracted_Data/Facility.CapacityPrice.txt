Paragraphs:
Facility Capacity Price is the
          price received by the Facility for capacity and is calculated as:

Capacity Price = ( periods_in_year Ã— Capacity Revenue ) / Installed Capacity

The period is the reported period type of Capacity Revenue.
          For example, if Capacity
            Revenue is reported daily, periods_in_year = 365 for a
          non-leap year and 366 for a leap year. If Capacity
            Revenue is reported monthly, periods_in_year = 12.

Note that the reported summary Capacity Price is calculated based a
          365-day year and thus the reported values are a little smaller than it
          should be in a leap year.
