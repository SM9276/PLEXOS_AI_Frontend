Paragraphs:
Generator SRMC is the marginal (incremental) cost of Generation , i.e. the variable cost associated with providing one more megawatt of generation, and is defined as:

If the generation is zero, the simulator reports the SRMC at Max Capacity .

The term 'Heat Production Value' only applies to CHP plant and reflects the incremental value of heat produced in terms of meeting a Heat Load . For example, a CHP generator with an auxiliary boiler can save boiler fuel when it increases electric  production at a rate determined by the Power to Heat Ratio .
