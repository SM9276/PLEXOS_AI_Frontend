Paragraphs:
Constraint Include in ST Schedule switches on/off enforcing the constraint in the ST Schedule simulation phase. The flag can take these values:

Note that constraints with a period greater than the step size of ST Schedule are automatically excluded unless they have been decomposed by the higher level MT Schedule and/or LT Plan phases.The value of this property cannot be changed during the simulation itself, i.e. it cannot be used to toggle the constraint in and out of the specific simulation phase.
