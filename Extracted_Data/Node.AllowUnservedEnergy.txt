Description:	Model Node [Unserved Energy] in the mathematical program.

Paragraphs:
Node Allow Unserved Energy gives finer resolution to the simulation setting Transmission Allow Unserved Energy . It can take these values:

The primary purpose of this property is to give finer control over the size of the mathematical program by allowing to you limit the number of unserved energy terms in the problem, and negate the need to use dummy generators.
