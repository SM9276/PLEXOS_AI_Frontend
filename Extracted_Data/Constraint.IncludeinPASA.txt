Header: Constraint Include in PASA

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Key Property:	No
Description:	If the constraint is modelled in the PASA phase.

Paragraphs:
Constraint Include in PASA switches on/off enforcing the constraint in the PASA (maintenance optimization) phase of the simulation. PASA considers generation and regional level transmission at the time of peak demand, thus intertemporal constraints such as energy limits are automatically excluded from PASA so this switch applies only to interval type constraints (those defined with RHS ). The flag can take these values:

The value of this property cannot be changed during the simulation itself, i.e. it cannot be used to toggle the constraint in and out of the specific simulation phase.
