Header: Region Internal VoLL Level

Table Details:
Units:	MWh
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	True
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Level of unserved energy VoLL applies to
1	1000	10000
2	2000	20000

Paragraphs:
This parameter can be paired with Internal VoLL to create VoLL as a function of lost load.
          Please note that it is not mandatory to specify internal VoLL level. An extra band is automatically created after the last specified band to capture unserved energy levels up to infinity.

Example: In the example below, we have 2 bands of unserved energy along with their value of lost load. Region VoLL of $2000/MWh is used if unserved energy is 
          greater than 10000 MWh, otherwise VoLL of $1000/MWh is used.
