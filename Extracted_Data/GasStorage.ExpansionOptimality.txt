Header: Gas Storage Expansion Optimality

Table Details:
Units:	-
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	In (0,2)
Key Property:	No
Description:	Expansion planning integerization scheme.

Paragraphs:
Gas Storage Expansion Optimality controls the integerization of build/retire decisions in LT Plan . 
          
          If discrete build points are specified using the multi-band option for Expansion Max Volume , Expansion Optimality should be set to Linear.
          This flag is only applicable when the LT Plan Optimality is Integer. When LT Plan Optimality is Linear then all builds are linear.
          It can take the following values:

NOTE: The option Optimality controls the linear/integer decision at the global level. You can also choose to integerize only part of the horizon using the switch Integerization Horizon .
