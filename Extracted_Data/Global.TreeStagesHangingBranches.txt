Paragraphs:
Global Tree Stages Hanging Branches
          controls the number of hanging branches in each stage of the Scenario
          Tree.

A hanging branch represents a scenario that begins at a given stage
          and continues to the end of the horizon without ever branching
          further. Hanging branches are scenarios in the simulation but do not
          appear in the reported output.

Note that, when using hanging branches you must keep the same number
          of full branches at each stage, as defined by the Tree
            Stage Leaves property.Also note that for simple trees you need
          only specify the number of hanging branches in Band=1 and it will be
          repeated to all stages.

For the example in Table 1, the Stochastic Risk Sample Count is 12
          and a 4-stage Scenario Tree is constructed with two full branches
          (these appear in the reported solution) and a total of 10 hanging
          branches. There are two hanging branches per full branch in stage one,
          one in stage two, and two again in stage three. This is illustrated in
          Figure 1.
