Description:	If constraint should be formulated to bound entity net profit risk

Paragraphs:
Entity Formulate Risk is a flag
          indicating if constraints should be formulated to bound the
          Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) of Net
            Profit when running a stochastic portfolio optimization ( ST
            Schedule Stochastic
            Method = "Stochastic") and the simulation is multi-sample ( Risk
            Sample Count > 1).

Constraints are formulated on the Net
            Profit in each scenario such that the values are no less than
          conditional value-at-risk ( Risk Level )
          at the Acceptable Risk .
