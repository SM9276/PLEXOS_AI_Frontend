Paragraphs:
Generator Min Stable Factor is
          the minimum stable generation level defined as a percentage of Max
            Capacity .

It is convenient to use this property instead of Min
            Stable Level when Max
            Capacity changes over time and Min
            Stable Level is always a set proportion of that value.

In this example Min Stable
            Level will always be 40% of Max
            Capacity .

Min Stable Factor can be defined as a multi-band property when used
          in conjunction with Generator Head
            Storage Efficiency
            Point to define a different minimum operating level depending on
          the amount of head available at a hydro generator.
