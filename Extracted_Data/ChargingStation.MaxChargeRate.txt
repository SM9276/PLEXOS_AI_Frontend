Charging Stations Max
          Charge Rate along with Units defines the charging capacity of the charging station. The property
          sets the maximum charge rate of each unit at the charging station,
          thus the maximum charge on the grid is Units x Max Charge Rate. This is the maximum rate of charge that can be
          applied across all connected Vehicles at any one time.
