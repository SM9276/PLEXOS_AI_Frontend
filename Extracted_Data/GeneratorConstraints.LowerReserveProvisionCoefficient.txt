Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Lower Reserve Provision
          Coefficient defines a left-hand side coefficient on the generator's
          provision of lower type reserve services in the constraint, which
          includes reserve provided by spinning reserve and increasing pump
          load, but excludes regulation reserves and synchronous condenser
          reserves.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

where:

By default, this sum includes all Generator Reserves of Type = "Lower" and "Operational". You can limit the set of Reserves included in this sum by adding Generator Reserves memberships with no
          associated property definitions. This is a special case of using
          'null' memberships to filter the terms included in another constraint
          property.
