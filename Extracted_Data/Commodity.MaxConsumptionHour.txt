Paragraphs:
Commodity Max Consumption Hour
          creates a Constraint object that
          limits the Consumption of
          the Commodity each hour. Note that this is the same as setting Max
            Consumption when Horizon Periods
            per Day is 24, and only applies for sub-hourly resolution
          modeling. By default this is a 'hard' constraint. To create a soft
          constraint, set the Max
            Consumption Penalty property.
