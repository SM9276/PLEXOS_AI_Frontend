Header: Stochastic SDDP Resampling

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	Flag if resampling is performed for each SDDP iteration at the beginning of the forward pass (The Scenario Tree must be created with PARMA model using Brazilian Methodology)

Paragraphs:
Stochastic SDDP Resampling is an
          advanced option for the SDDP algorithm. When enabled, resampling is performed for each SDDP
          iteration at the beginning of the forward pass. The Scenario Tree must
          be created with PARMA model using Brazilian
            Methodology . Resampling can improve convergence.
