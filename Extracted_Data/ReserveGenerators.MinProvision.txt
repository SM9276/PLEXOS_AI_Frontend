Paragraphs:
Reserve Generators Min Provision defines an amount of reserve provision that must be provided by the generator. The following constraint is added to the mathematical programming problem:

This limit applies regardless of whether or not the unit is generating and thus captures provision from spinning and non-spinning reserves. Note that if the generator has no Available Capacity the limit is relaxed.
