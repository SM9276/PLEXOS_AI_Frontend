Units:	Wh/km (Metric), Wh/m (U.S. Imperial)
Mode:	Input/Output
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	200
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Key Property:	No
Description:	Electric vehicle efficiency

Paragraphs:
Vehicle efficiency is the energy required in watt-hours to 
            travel one unit of distance (km or miles). This is a physical property of the vehicle and governed by 
            factors such as electric motor and drivetrain efficiencies, friction and air resistance. In the metric system this is measured in watt-hours per kilometre
            (Wh/km) and Imperial US it is measured in watt-hours per mile
            (Wh/m). Efficiency concerns the motor and battery system only and
            is therefore unrelated to Charging Efficiency or Auxiliary Consumption . Output As an output efficiency reflects the input value.
