Paragraphs:
Facility Min Operating Factor is
          the minimum production level required when operating.

How Min Operating Factor is interpreted (as a facility-wide value or
          unit-by-unit)  depends on the Min
            Operating Level Global setting. By default it is expressed as a
          proportion of the unit Max
            Operating Level . Setting this creates the following constraints:

Production ≥ Units Operating × Max
            Operating Level × Min Operating Factor

Units
            Operating integer

Alternatively, it can be the minimum as a function of Installed
            Capacity , creating the following constraints:

Production ≥ Operating × Max Operating
            Level × Units

"Operating" binary



Note that the integrality constraint is relaxed if Unit
            Commitment Optimality is set to "Linear Relaxation" since Units
            Operating in that case is a continuous variable.

In this example the minimum Production of the facility will always be 40% of the committed capacity .

As an alternative you can specify the Min
            Operating Level directly.
