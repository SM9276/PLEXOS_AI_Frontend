Header: Diagnostic Unit Commitment

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	Write diagnostics for the Rounded Relaxation unit commitment algorithm
Step	Simulation step number
Sample	Sample number in the current step (for multi-sample simulations)
Pass	Rounding pass number (there can be 1-3 of these)
Region	The Region the Generator is in
Generator	The Main.Generator
Unit	The generating unit number for the current Generator
Period	The period number in the current simulation step
SRMC	The short-run marginal cost of the Generator
Price Received	The price received by the Generator
Generation	The generation of the Generator
Reserve	The spare capacity used to provide reserve by the Generator
UC Before	The unit commitment before rounding
UC After	The unit commitment after rounding
Min Stable Level	The min stable level of the Generator
Rating	The rating of the Generator
Available Units	The number of available units at the Generator
Deficit	Capacity deficit in the Region after rounding
Energy Constrained	Yes/No flag if the Generator is energy-constrained
Min Up Time	The min up time of the Generator
Hours Up	The number of hours since the unit started up
Min Up Time Active	Yes/No flag if the min up time impacted the rounding decision
Min Down Time	The min down time of the Generator
Hours Down	The number of hours since the unit shut down
Min Down Time Active	Yes/No flag if the min down time impacted the rounding decision
