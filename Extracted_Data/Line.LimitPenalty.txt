Description:	Penalty for exceeding the flow limits on the line

Paragraphs:
Line Limit Penalty defines the penalty cost for exceeding the thermal limit of the line as defined by Max Flow / Max Rating (reference direction) and Min Flow / Min Rating (counter reference direction). Thus this property makes the thermal limit a 'soft constraint' that will be violated if the cost of violation is less than the production cost savings that would result.

The amount of violation is reported as Violation and the cost incurred as Violation Cost .

Note: - Setting a value of zero for Limit Penalty means that the flow are allowed to violate the limits without incurring any violation cost.- Limit penalty is currently not considered in LT plan for expansion candidate.
