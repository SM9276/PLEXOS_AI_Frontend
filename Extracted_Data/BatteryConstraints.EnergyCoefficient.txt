Paragraphs:
Battery Constraints Energy Coefficient is Coefficient of energy stored in the BESS.

Energy Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of the battery's End Energy variable/column in the generic constraint equation.

Example: A company owns a large number of batteries in their electric vehicle fleets or Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system. Outside of normal operating hours (i.e night time or holidays), these idle batteries can be rented by the grid and provide services such as managing peak loads and smoothing renewable energy productions. For instance, during peak hours when load demand is high and renewable energy production is low, these batteries are controlled to reduce their charging power or even switch to discharging mode and inject energy to the grid. On the other hand, they resume normal charging power during off-peak hours. However, it is usually required that these batteries need to reach a certain energy value before the operating hours of the company. In order to enforce this requirement to the simulation, the energy coefficient property can be used to set that targeted/desired energy level for the batteries at the specific time.
