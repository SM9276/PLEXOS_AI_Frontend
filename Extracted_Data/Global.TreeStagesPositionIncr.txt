Paragraphs:
Global Tree Stages Position Incr works as an alternative to Tree Stages Position in defining the position of each stage using
          multi-bands. Here is an example,

This automatically positions stages weekly for the first 52 weeks and then every second week after that to the end of the horizon.
          Please notice that the parameter for the last stage is not required. Also note
          that Tree Stages Position Inc will be overridden by Tree Stages Position if both of them are defined.
