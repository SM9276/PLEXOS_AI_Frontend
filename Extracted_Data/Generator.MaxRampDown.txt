Paragraphs:
Generator Max Ramp Down sets a
          limit on the rate at which the generator can decrease production and
          is expressed in megawatts per minute. This property is multi-band
          which allows for different ramp limits depending on the generation
          level. If a single band is defined, then this limit applies for Generation ranges between Min Stable
            Level and Max Capacity ,
          unless Run Down Rate or Shutdown Profile are
          defined in which case this ramping limit applies before shutdown
          begins.

To define different ramp limits depending on generation level, pair
          bands of the Max Ramp Down with Ramp
            Down Point .

For multi-unit generating stations the available ramp down is defined
          as:

When modelling Reserve the amount of
          available ramping down capability may be reduced by the provision of
          lower ancillary services. See the Response
            Ratio property for more details.

By default the ramping limit is a hard constraint meaning that no
          violation is allowed. To create soft constraints with a penalty price
          use the Max Ramp Down
            Penalty property.

To model the running down period where Generation is between Min Stable Level and zero use either the Shutdown
            Profile or Run Down Rate properties.
