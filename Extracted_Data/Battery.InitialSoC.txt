Paragraphs:
Battery Initial SoC is the initial State of Charge of a BESS unit, at the start of the first period of the Horizon .

Example:

The example shows a typical set up for a BESS unit.

When the following conditions are satisfied, Initial SoC may be freely optimized by PLEXOS (any value from 0 to 100%): Chronology is Sampled , The battery duration (ratio of Capacity to Max Power ) is short 
                relative to the Sampling Interval . Under the above conditions, freely optimized initial SoC generally results in lower cost, more robust solutions in comparisons to those which
            strictly adhere to user-defined initial SoC.

As an extreme case, consider sampling only 1 day per year with End Effects Method set to 'Recycle'.
            A user-defined initial SoC essentially fixes the SoC for one interval duration in each day of the year. If initial SoC is say 0% and simulations start from midnight, the battery cannot
            effectively be used in a solar soak application to meet nighttime demand, as it will be empty every midnight. 
            The one-time costs of filling low-duration batteries are contextually negligible 
            when amortised over the entire Planning Horizon .
