Paragraphs:
Generator Offer Price Scalar is a scaling factor that can be applied to the Offer Price property.

Example

In the above example the generator forms a two-band balancing offer with a base determined by a day-ahead solution read from a Data File . To convert day-ahead Generation which is a non-negative number into a decrement offer band, which is a negative number, the Offer Quantity Scalar is set to negative one for band one. Offer Price Scalar is then used to create two price bands, one just below and one just above the day-ahead short-run marginal cost of the generator.
