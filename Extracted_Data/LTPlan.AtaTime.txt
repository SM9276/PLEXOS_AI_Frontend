Description:	Number of years solved in each step of LT Plan

Paragraphs:
The default behavior of LT Plan is to
          optimize the entire planning horizon in one 'step', and this is the
          ideal solution. However, for very large models it might be necessary
          to break the optimization into multiple steps or to resolve the
          horizon progressively using Rolling Horizon. The method used is
          controlled by the Overlap setting
          combined with Step Size.

For the multi-step method, this option controls the number of
              years solved in each step. A value of '0' means that the entire
              horizon is solved in one step.

Note that you must select a number of
              years that divides the years in the planning horizon precisely.
              For example, the following combinations are valid:

The following are not valid:

Note that these methods work independently of the Chronology setting, meaning you can further reduce the computational burden of
          the simulation by choosing Partial, Fitted or Sampled chronologies.
