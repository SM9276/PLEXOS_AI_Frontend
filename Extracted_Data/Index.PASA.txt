Table Details:
Compute Multi-area Reliability Indices	Yes/No	0	In (0,-1)	Master switch for computation of reliability indices LOLP, LOLE, etc across multiple areas.
Compute Reliability Indices	Yes/No	0	In (0,-1)	Master switch for computation of reliability indices LOLP, LOLE, etc.
Constraints Enabled	Yes/No	-1	In (0,-1)	If transmission line constraints are enabled in PASA.
Include Contract Generation	Yes/No	0	In (0,-1)	Include physical contract generation capacity in PASA
Include Contract Load	Yes/No	0	In (0,-1)	Include physical contract load capacity in PASA
Include Demand Bids	Yes/No	0	In (0,-1)	Include demand bids are load in PASA
Include DSP	Yes/No	-1	In (0,-1)	Include demand-side participation in PASA
Include Market Purchases	Yes/No	0	In (0,-1)	Include market purchases as generation capacity in PASA
Interface Constraints Enabled	Yes/No	-1	In (0,-1)	If transmission interface constraints are enabled in PASA.
Maintenance Sculpting	%	0	Between 0 And 100	Level of sculpting of maintenance outages: Higher sculpting means outages are more concentrated in high reserve periods
Reliability Criterion	-	0	In (0,1)	Criterion used to select periods for Monte Carlo reliability analysis
Reliability LOLP Tolerance	-	0.01	≥0	For reliability-based sampled chronology using LOLP criterion select intervals with LOLP at or above this level
Reliability Max Samples	h	1E+30	≥1	For reliability-based sampled chronology select no more than this many hours per year
Step Type	-	1	In (0,1,2)	PASA step type: One period is modelled for each period of this type in horizon.
Stochastic Method	-	0	In (0,1,2,3)	Stochastic optimization method for PASA.
Transmission Detail	-	0	In (0,1,2)	Definition of maintenance area for PASA.
Write Outage Text Files	Yes/No	0	In (0,-1)	If outage patterns should be written to text files
Write Reliability Text Files	Yes/No	0	In (0,-1)	If the periods selected for Monte Carlo reliability analysis should be written to text files
