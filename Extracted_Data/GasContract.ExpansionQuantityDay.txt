Description:	LT Max daily gas offtake associated with the contract

Paragraphs:
Gas Contract Expansion Quantity Day is expansion quantity daily gas offtake associated with the contract.
          
          For Gas Contract Expansion Optimality, Expansion Optimality should be set to Linear if discrete build points are specified using the multi-band option for Expansion Quantity Day.

See also:

Expansion Quantity Day is the amount of potential daily gas offtake during an LT plan optimization. For an expansion contract, an LT plan will choose the optimal level of offtake for the contract. The resulting Quantity Day from the LT plan are utilized in the subsequent phases.

Multi-band Expansion Quantity Day inputs are interpreted as fixed decision points for an expansion plan. LT plan expansion decision must select one of the specified bands.

Example:

Expansion Quantity Day for Contract C1 is specified as a multi-band input. The resulting Quantity Day from the LT plan must equal one of the 5 band values. 
          In contrast Expansion Quantity Day for Contract C2 is a single-band input. The LT plan is free to choose to any value between 0 and 70TJ as the optimal Expansion Quantity Day for C2.
