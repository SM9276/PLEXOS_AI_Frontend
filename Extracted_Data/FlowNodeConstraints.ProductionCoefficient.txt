Description:	Coefficient of Commodity production at the Flow Node in the Constraint

Paragraphs:
Flow Node Constraints Production Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient
          of the Production in the
          constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × Flow
            Node Production ... {≤, ≥, =} b j
