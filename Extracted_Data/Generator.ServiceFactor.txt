Description:	Proportion of installed capacity available for generation

Paragraphs:
Generator Service Factor is the
          proportion of installed capacity that is available i.e. not
          on outage, and defined as:

Service Factor = 100 x ( Installed
            Capacity - Maintenance - Forced Outages ) / Installed
            Capacity

Note the definition allows for partial outages therefore even with a
          single unit facility the Service Factor can be fractional.
