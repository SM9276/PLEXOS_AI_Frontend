Users can use one such variable for multiple objects instead of creating one variable for each object. Note, maximum only one such variable can be set per object.
Model	UseQuadraticRescaleProfile	Boolean	true		false	Option to use Quadratic growth method in rescaling the sampled data if the fitting using Linear method is not ideal, setting to false will revert to the original Linear method.
