Paragraphs:
Performance Hot Start Optimizer
          sets the optimization algorithm used by the selected SOLVER to solve the second and subsequent problems of each simulation step i.e. when any iteration is required for e.g. convergence of
          transmission constraints, or dynamic bidding. The available values for
          this option are described on the SOLVER page.
