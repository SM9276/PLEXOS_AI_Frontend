Paragraphs:
Market Max Sales Hour creates a Constraint object that sets an upper
          bound on the Sales from the Market
          each hour. By default this is a 'hard' constraint. This property only
          applies to sub-hourly simulations i.e. where Horizon Periods per Day is greater
          than 24.
