Header: Generator Unit Commitment Non-anticipativity

Table Details:
Units:	$
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Price for violating non-anticipativity constraints in scenario-wise decomposition mode
Big Plant	Unit Commitment Non-anticipativity	-1	$	This value acts like infinity, so no recourse is
                available
Big Plant	Unit Commitment Non-anticipativity Time	36	hrs	
Small Plant	Unit Commitment Non-anticipativity	0	$	Full recourse is available on unit commitment of
                this unit

Paragraphs:
Generator Unit Commitment
          Non-anticipativity applies to multi-sample simulations with Stochastic
            Method = "Stochastic" i.e. stochastic optimization
          using scenario-wise decomposition. It is used to identify the
          non-anticipative Unit
            Commitment decisions, can optionally be set in combination with Unit
            Commitment Non-anticipativity Time .

Defining the property adds the following "non-anticipativity"
          constraints to the formulation:

Units
            Generating ( s , t ) = Units
            Generating ( s +1, t ) âˆ€ s < S

where: s is the sample number S = Stochastic Risk Sample Count

The property can take any value, but there are two special cases to
          consider:

Any positive value then acts as a penalty on anticipating the values
          of the uncertain inputs. It is a useful feature that the
          non-anticipativity can be relaxed over time as Table 1.

The property is commonly used in short-term two-stage stochastic unit
          commitment models to ensure that unit commitment decisions
          do not anticipate future information.
