Description:	Jump frequency in jump-diffusion model

Paragraphs:
Variable Jump Frequency is the number of jumps per year (assume 365 days a year) in the jump-diffusion model.

The number of jumps per period should be a value much smaller than 1.0, otherwise the resolution is too low and the generated sample is not good.
