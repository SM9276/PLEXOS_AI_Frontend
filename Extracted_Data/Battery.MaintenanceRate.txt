Paragraphs:
PLEXOS automatically distributes maintenance events throughout the simulation horizon during the PASA simulation phase. Maintenance Rate is the fraction of time (annually) that the units are expected to be out-of-service (OOS) due to scheduled maintenance events.

See Generator Maintenance Rate for further information and examples.

As an output, Maintenance Rate is the percentage of time the unit
              is out-of-service on maintenance either as a result of defining
