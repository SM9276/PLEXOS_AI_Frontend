Description:	If the periods selected for Monte Carlo reliability analysis should be written to text files

Paragraphs:
This PASA option relates to the MT
            Schedule Reliability Chronology feature. When
          enabled, two text files are written at the end of the PASA phase. The first lists the periods selected by PASA based on the Reliability
            Criterion and the value of that criterion ( LOLP or Capacity Reserves ). The
          second lists all hours in the horizon and indicates if they were
          selected. This second file is suitable as input via Global Sampled Periods in the case
          that you prefer to run MT Schedule without first running the reliability period selection in PASA .
