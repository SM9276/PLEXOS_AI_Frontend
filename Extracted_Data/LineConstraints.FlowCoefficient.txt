Paragraphs:
Line Constraints Flow Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient on the transmission
          line's net flow in the reference direction.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

The directional versions of this coefficient are Flow
            Forward Coefficient and Flow
            Back Coefficient .
