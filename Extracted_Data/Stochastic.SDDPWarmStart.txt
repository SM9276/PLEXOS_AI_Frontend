Header: Stochastic SDDP Warm Start

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	If the first forward pass of SDDP is replaced by fixed 'warm start' storage levels

Paragraphs:
This switch enables the 'warm start' feature in the SDDP algorithm. When warm start is enabled the first forward pass is
          skipped and storage levels at each stage are assumed to be at the SDDP Warm Start Level .Â 
          Warm start can given SDDP a better starting point and reduce the
          number of iterations to convergence.
