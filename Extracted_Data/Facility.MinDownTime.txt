Description:	Minimum number of hours a unit must be off after being shut down

Paragraphs:
Facility Min Down Time is the
          minimum number of hours the unit must be off in any commitment cycle.
          The number of hours down is reported in the property Hours
            Down .  Min Down Time is a static property. If it
          is defined dynamically (varying according to different periods), the
          maximum value will be used.

By default, Min Down Time is enforced after any shutdown
          event including forced outages. If you prefer that units are available
          for commitment immediately after repair following a forced outage,
          turn on the Production setting Forced Outage
            Relaxes Min Down Time .

To model a dynamic MDT use custom constraints. For example, consider
          a Facility with MDT of 6 hours but only between the hours 12pm to 6.00
          am (next day). Assuming that the Facility has one unit and the
          simulation resolution is hourly, for time slice H12-6, the custom
          constraint is written using HoursDownCoefficient , UnitsShutDownCoefficient and time lag such as:

HoursDownCoefficient t +6 ≥ 6 UnitsShutDownCoefficient t

For other time slices, set these coefficients to be zero and the
          constraint will be deactivated.
