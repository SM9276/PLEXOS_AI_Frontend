Table Details:
Discount Period Type	-	2	In (1,2,3,4,6,7)	A unique discount factor will be computed for each of these periods.
Discount Rate	%	0	≥0	Discount rate.
End Effects Method	-	1	In (0,1)	Method used to account for end of horizon discounting
Sequential Steps	-	1	≥1	Number of steps run in each sequential block when running in parallel Step Link Mode
Step Link Mode	-	0	In (0,1,2)	Controls how the solutions of each step are linked together.
Step Relink Count	-	1	≥1	Number of steps that require relinking of initial conditions in parallel Step Link Mode, where 1 means no relinking
Stochastic Method	-	1	In (0,1,2,3)	Stochastic optimization method for ST Schedule
Storage Formulate Head Effects	Yes/No	-1	In (0,-1)	If storage head effects should be formulated in ST Schedule.
