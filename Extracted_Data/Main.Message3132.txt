Description:	The specified output path and file name are too long. The solution will be written to the following temporary location: <value>

Paragraphs:
Microsoft Windows has the inherent limitation that no file path can be greater than 260 characters long. In the case when PLEXOS attempts to create a solution output path greater than this length PLEXOS will instead save all solution data in a temporary location which it details in the log file.
