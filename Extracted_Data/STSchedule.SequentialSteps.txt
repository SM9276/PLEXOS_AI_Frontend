Description:	Number of steps run in each sequential block when running in parallel Step Link Mode

Paragraphs:
ST Schedule Sequential Steps
          applies when Step Link Mode = "Parallel".  It defines the number of steps that should be run
          together in a regular sequential (linked) block. These blocks of steps
          are then run in parallel.

For example, if the ST Schedule Step Type = "Day" and At
            a Time = 1 (i.e. ST Schedule is running day steps) and you set
          Sequential Steps = 7 then each block of 7 days will run as a regular
          sequential simulation with ending conditions of one day feeding the
          initial conditions of the next, and parallelization will be applied to
          each block of 7 days with the optimization free to choose initial
          conditions every 7 days.

Note that you can also apply relinking between the parallel blocks of steps, however it is generally better
          to set a longer group of Sequential Steps than trigger relinking
          between the step groups.
