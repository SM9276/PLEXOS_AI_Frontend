Header: Transmission Constraint Voltage Threshold

Table Details:
Units:	kV
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Description:	Voltage level at which thermal limits are modelled.

Paragraphs:
Transmission Constraint Voltage Threshold sets the voltage level at which line and transformer (branch) thermal limits are enforced. This relies on the node voltages being defined a priori . By default all branch limits are enforced if the Transmission Constraints Enabled switch is on.
