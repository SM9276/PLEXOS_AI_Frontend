Paragraphs:
Facility Ramp Up is the total
          ramping up in the period, and is defined as:

Ramp Up = MAX (0, Production t - Production ( t -1) )

where: t indexes periods of the
            simulation. The t =0 value of Production refers to the
            previous simulation step and for step one it is set with the Initial
              Production property.

This is distinct from Ramp which
          reports the ramping rate in minute. Ramp Up can be used in
          combination with Minutes of
            Ramp Up to determine the intensity of ramping up over any
          period.
