Paragraphs:
Flow Node Build Cost is the
              cost of building a new Flow Node for LT
                Plan . This cost can be defined in combination with Economic
                Life and WACC so that LT Plan computes an annuity as
              described in the article LT Plan .
              If Build Cost is defined without these parameters then the entire
              cost is incurred in the period the Flow Node is added.

As output Build Cost is the total cost of Units
                Built in the reporting period.
