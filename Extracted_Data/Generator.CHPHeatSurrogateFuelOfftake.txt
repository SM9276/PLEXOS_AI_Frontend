Paragraphs:
Generator CHP Heat Surrogate Fuel Offtake is a notional measure approach to which is used to estimate fuel offtake replacement in heat production delivered through CHP generation.

The proportion of fuel offtake for heat production is estimated by the user input property [CHP Heat Surrogate Heat Rate Incr]:

CHP Heat Surrogate Fuel Offtake = CHP Heat Surrogate Heat Rate Incr * CHP Heat Production
