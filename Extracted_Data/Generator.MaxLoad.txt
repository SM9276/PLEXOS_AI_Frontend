Paragraphs:
Generator Max Load sets an upper
          bound on unit Generation . The Generator is allowed to provide Raise Reserve and/or Regulation
            Raise Reserve with the remainder of its spare capacity up to the Rating . The property is useful for
          modelling energy-constrained resources such as hydro that are limited
          in generation but may still provide reserve.

Example

In the following example the Generator "hydro" is limited in generation by a profile read from a CSV file,
          but can provide reserve up to its Max
            Capacity , whereas "solar" is limited through the Rating property and can provide generation and reserve only up to that limit.
