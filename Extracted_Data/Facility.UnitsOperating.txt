Description:	Number of units operating

Paragraphs:
This is the number of units operating. A unit is counted as operating
          once it has been started and is producing above notional zero level.

For short-term modeling you can set the number of units operating in
          the period immediately preceding the start of the simulation ( t =0)
          using the property Initial
            Units Operating , otherwise the optimization will freely choose
          the initial commitment state of the units on/off depending on which is
          best in terms of overall system cost.

Units Operating will be a value between zero and the number of Units plus any Units Built (in LT
            Plan ) less any Units Out .

Integer values of Units Operating i.e. integer unit
          commitment is enforced if:
