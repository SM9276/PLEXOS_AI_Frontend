Paragraphs:
Gas Demand Demand is the quantity of gas demanded in each simulation interval. This is a multi-band property, where the various bands can be used to separate the input of different customer demands. The demand used in the simulation is the sum across all defined bands.

Demand is distributed to the associated Gas Nodes according to the Demand Participation Factor .

Example

Here the gas demand is read from an external text file in two bands.

NOTE : This input is a quantity of gas demanded in each simulation interval, not a per hour rate . For simulation  with Horizon Periods per Day other than 24, the quantities should be set appropriately.
