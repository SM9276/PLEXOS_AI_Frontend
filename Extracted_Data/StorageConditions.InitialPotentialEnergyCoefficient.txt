Header: Storage Conditions Initial Potential Energy Coefficient

Table Details:
Units:	GWh
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Coefficient of the initial potential energy in storage in the condition equation

Paragraphs:
This is the coefficient of Storage Initial Potential Energy in the Variable condition equation.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the left-hand side of the condition equation:

… + a (i,j) × Storage Initial Potential Energy … {<,≤, ≥,>, =} Profile

Note that the left-hand side of the equation is available in the
          property Variable Activity and this value can be used not only as a condition test but also to
          modify other input properties via the Action and Expression fields in
          the data grid, thus allowing you to multiply two input properties.
