Financial Contract Quantity sets the volume of the contract.

Example:

In a Gross Pool this example defines a contract-for-differences ( CfD ), or two-way contract, with a strike price of $55/ MWh . The contract guarantees the generator receives at least this price for generation, and at the same time it guarantees that the load will pay no more than this price for the quantities shown.
