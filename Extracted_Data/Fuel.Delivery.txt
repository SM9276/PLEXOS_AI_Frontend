Paragraphs:
Fuel Delivery is an amount of the Fuel delivered to into inventory. This is
          the only way in which the inventory can be replenished.

It is important to note that Delivery represents a discrete quantity
          of fuel not a rate, hence you should define the property dynamically
          as in the following example:

Example

In this example a delivery of 750 TJ of "Oil" occurs on the first day
          of each week.
