Paragraphs:
Generator Forced Outage is
              the production capacity lost to random outages. It can be used as
              an input to define a known pattern of outages and can be defined
              with a Variable object or passed
              as an input from an Interleaved simulation to coordinate outage between models.

As output Forced Outage is:

( Max
