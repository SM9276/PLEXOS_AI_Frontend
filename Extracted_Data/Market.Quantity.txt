Paragraphs:
Market Quantity sets the quantity
          part of the market supply/demand function when modelling a market with
          depth i.e. a market where the volume of sales or purchases
          affects the price received / paid . Quantity is used in pairs
          identified by band number with the Price property. The Base Quantity defines the cross-over point between selling into the market and
          buying as explained in the following example.

This example defines the demand function shown in Figure 1. The Base
            Quantity sets the reference point separating sales (above) from
          purchases (below). The highest Quantity point forms an upper bound on
          sales into the market i.e. the maximum sales is the highest
          Quantity less Base Quantity .
          Likewise the maximum purchases from the market is set by Base
            Quantity less the lowest Quantity point. These bounds can be
          overridden using the Max Sales and Max Purchases properties.



Figure 1: Market Supply/Demand Function

Notice how the P/Q pairs are interpreted as points on a demand
            curve, and a step function is fitted through them automatically. You
            can control the step function directly by setting the Demand
              Curve property to false. This would result in the step
            function shown in Figure 2.
