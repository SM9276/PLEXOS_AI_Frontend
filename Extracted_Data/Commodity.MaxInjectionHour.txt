Paragraphs:
Commodity Max Injection Hour
          creates a Constraint object that
          limits the Injection of the
          Commodity into inventory each hour. Note that this is the same as
          setting Max Injection when Horizon Periods
            per Day is 24, and only applies for sub-hourly resolution
          modeling. By default this is a 'hard' constraint. To create a soft
          constraint, create a Constraint with a Penalty Price .
