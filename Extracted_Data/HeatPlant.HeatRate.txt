Header: Heat Plant Heat Rate

Table Details:
Units:	GJ/GJ (Metric), MMBtu/MMBtu (U.S. Imperial)
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	True
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Key Property:	No
Description:	Average heat rate (total fuel divided by total heat production)

Paragraphs:
Heat Plant Heat Rate is the average heat rate used in defining the heat rate function .

For example, heat rate = 3 GJ/GJ. This means that for every 1 GJ of heat production, the heat plant will consumes 3 GJ value of heat from burning fuels.
Note that heat rate is normally bigger than or equal to 1 to represent losses.
