Paragraphs:
Water Storage Reference Level is used to estimate storage level as a function of 
          storage volume when the cross section area of the storage may not be constant. 
          Along with Reference Volume , the user inputs tranches of 
          coordinate points that will be used to fit the polynomial equation: Storage Level = p 3 *Storage_Volume 3 + p 2 *Storage_Volume 2 + p 1 *Storage_Volume + p 0

Storage Level = p 3 *Storage_Volume 3 + p 2 *Storage_Volume 2 + p 1 *Storage_Volume + p 0
