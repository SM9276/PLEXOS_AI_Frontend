Paragraphs:
Charging Station Deferrable
          Load is a multi-band property that works in combination with Deferment
            Period . It sets the proportion of charging load that can be
          deferred in the given band. Deferring load can reduce the cost of
          charging by shifting some or all of the charging load into future
          periods with a lower electric price.

Deferrable load represents potential deviations from prescribed charging profiles which are defined prior to 
            simulation commencement. Deferment should therefore be used in conjunction with simple Vehicle models (which define Fixed Load ). Non-simple 
            (i.e. detailed) vehicle models allow charging to occur at times and quantities that minimise total system cost: deferment 
            is redundant when charging is cooptimised in this way. Warning 3245 will occur
            if deferment is being used in conjunction with detailed vehicle models. See Vehicle for 
            a comparison of simple and detailed vehicle models.



In the above example 90% of the charging load can be deferred by one
          hour, which includes the 75% that can be deferred up to two hours,
          etc.
