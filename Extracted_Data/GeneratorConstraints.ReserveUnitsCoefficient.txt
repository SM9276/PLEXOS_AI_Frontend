Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Reserve Units Coefficient defines a left-hand side coefficient on the binary variable x indicating if the generator provides reserve services in the period.

With the coefficient represented by \[a_{(i,j)}\] the following term is added to the formulation:

where \[i\] indexes the Reserves provided by the Generator
