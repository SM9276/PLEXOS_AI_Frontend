Paragraphs:
As an input, Storage Natural Inflow
          is the rate of natural inflow to the storage. When the Storage Model is set to "Potential Energy"
          this property is in megawatts of potential energy i.e. it is
          a equivalent rate of inflow not the volume of inflow. When the Model is "Level" or metric "Volume" it is the rate of inflow in native units
          of storage per second e.g. cubic metres per second (cumecs).
          In the Imperial US "Volume" Model the units are AF/hr. Thus the units for natural inflow are independent
          of the length of the simulation intervals.

Often it is convenient to point the input of Natural Inflow to a Data File as in the this example:

Example:

As an output the property is calculated as:

The increment and scaling properties can be used to apply
          combinations of Escalator and Variable to the Natural Inflow.
