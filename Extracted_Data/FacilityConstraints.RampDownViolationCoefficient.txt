Paragraphs:
Facility Constraints Ramp Down Violation Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of Facility Ramp
            Down Violation in the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × Facility Ramp Down Violation ) ... {≤, ≥, =} b j
