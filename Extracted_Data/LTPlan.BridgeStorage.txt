Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	True (-1)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	If LT Plan should bridge (decompose) storage for subsequent simulation phases

Paragraphs:
This switch toggles on/off bridging (decomposition) of storage
          objects (from classes: Storage, Commodity, Flow Storage, Fuel,
          Generator, Heat Storage, Gas Storage, etc) from LT
            Plan to subsequent simulation phases ( MT
