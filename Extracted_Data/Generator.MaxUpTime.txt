Description:	Maximum number of hours a unit can be run after being started

Paragraphs:
Generator Max Up Time is the
          maximum number of hours a unit can be run after being started. A unit
          is considered 'up' if its Generation is non-zero. The number of hours up is reported in the property Hours Up . Max Up Time is a static property. If it is defined dynamically (varying according to different
          periods), the maximum value will be used.

This constraint is useful for modelling demand-side options such as
          industrial refrigeration, which can be invoked at peak times but must
          be restored to normal load within a given number of hours.
