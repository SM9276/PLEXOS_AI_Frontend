Paragraphs:
Flow Path Max Flow is the maximum
          flow in any interval on the Flow Path in the notional forward
          direction i.e. from the Flow
            Node From to the Flow Node
            To .  You can also limit the flow by Hour , Day , Week , Month or Year .

For the example in Table 1, the Flow Path is uni-directional with a
          maximum flow of 550.

Note that negative values of Max Flow are allowed, and imply that a
          minimum amount of flow must occur in the notional backward direction.
