Paragraphs:
This option applies only when the scenario tree is constructed with multiple full branches. 
                    It needs to be set as True when the model has properties besides (or other than) Storage Natural Inflow that need to 
                    be stochastic and doing historical or PARMA sampling, and/or the model has any variable doing random sampling.
