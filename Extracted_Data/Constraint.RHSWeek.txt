Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Right hand side each week (000)

Paragraphs:
Constraint RHS Week defines the right-hand side (constant) term for each week of the planning horizon. Setting this property defines the period of the constraint as one constraint per week. The definition of week is controlled by the Horizon Week Beginning attribute.

NOTE: In most cases for RHS Day/Week/Month/Year/Custom, the RHS scalar is 1000. However, there are some exceptions where the RHS scalar is 1. The exceptions include all non-quantity constraints, 
            all gas constraints, Maintenance Min Occurrence constraints, constraints related to Storages (with End Volume/End Level/Ramp Coefficient) / Waterways (with Ramp Coefficient) / Maintenances 
            (with Start Hour Coefficient) / Generators (with Capacity Factor Coefficient or only defined interval Units Started/Units Shutdown/Units Generating/Operating Hours/Pump Operating Hours Coefficient), 
            constraints using expansion, and constraints not using activities.
