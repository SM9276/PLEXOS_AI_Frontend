Key Property:	No
Description:	End of hour vehicle stored energy target

Paragraphs:
Vehicle Energy Target Hour is end of hour stored energy target. Energy Target Hour adds a constraint on the Vehicle's energy level at the end of each hour.

Note: if the simulation interval is greater than on hour, there is insufficient resolution to resolve this property, and it will have no effect.

Vehicle SoC must be formulated for it
                to be constrained. This property is therefore only valid with detailed Vehicle models (those defining energy storage properties such as Capacity and Efficiency ). Detailed and simple vehicle models are described in Vehicle .
