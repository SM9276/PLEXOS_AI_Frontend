Paragraphs:
Facility Units is the number
              of installed units at the facility. This can simply indicate the
              existence (1) or not (0) of a single unit, or the presence of
              multiple units. For multi-unit facilities the units are treated
              identically and properties such as Max
                Operating Level apply to each unit thus there is no need to
              adjust other properties on the Facility when the number of units
              changes. The number of units can change via input at any time
              during the simulation horizon and there is no limit to the number
              of units.

The number of units can increase in LT
                Plan according to Max
                Units Built and reduced by Max
                Units Retired . Units can automatically retire if the Technical
                Life property is set.

There is a performance advantage in modeling using multi-unit
              facilities because Production is assumed to be spread evenly across the Units
                Operating . However, when detailed unit commitment is
              modeled e.g. start up and shutdown, unit commitment is
              tracked unit-by-unit.

As output, Units reports the net of existing units and those
              built or retired in LT Plan thus:

Units (output) = Units (input) + Units
              Built - Units Retired
