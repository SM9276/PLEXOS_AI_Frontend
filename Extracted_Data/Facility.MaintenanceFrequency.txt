Paragraphs:
Facility Maintenance Frequency sets
          the number of maintenance events that will occur of the given type
          each year. This is usually for scheduling large surveys or overhauls
          rather than more regular, smaller maintenance events.

In this example a major survey of 300 hours must be taken every three
          years (in 2006 and 2009).

Different types of maintenance can be modeled by separating the
          outage types by band number as in the examples in the Maintenance
            Rate topic.
