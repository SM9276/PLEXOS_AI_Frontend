            Reference for a detailed list of properties for this class of
          object.

The Diagnostic class provides access to diagnostics from the
          simulation engine. To apply a Diagnostic object to your Model add it
          to the Model's Diagnostic collection. Note that associating the object with a Model defines the global settings, but you can optionally associate it with
          individual simulation phases e.g. LT
            Plan to run different settings in different phases of your
          simulation.
