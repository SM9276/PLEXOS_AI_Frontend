Paragraphs:
Variable Value is the actual
          sample value, which is the Raw Value processed to be within Min Value and Max Value and through any
          defined Look-up Table (in that
          order).

The processing is done to any Variable for which the Sampling Method is "Random Sampling" or "Expected Value" i.e. even if the
          expected value is provided as input it is still processed through the
          min/max and look-up table to produce the simulation value.

In summary data this is the mean sample value.

For Conditional Variables,
          Value is a boolean indicating if the expression defining the condition
          is true or false.

Note: Variable values are reported as zero unless they are associated with a property.
