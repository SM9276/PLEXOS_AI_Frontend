Description:	Expansion max volume associated with the Gas Storage

Paragraphs:
Gas Storage Expansion Max Volume is the maximum expansion volume associated with the Gas Storage.

Expansion Max Volume is the amount of potential Max Volume during LT plan optimization. For an expansion storage, an LT plan will choose the optimal size of the storage Max Volume. The resulting Max Volume from the LT plan are utilized in the subsequent phases.

Multi-band Expansion Max Volume inputs are interpreted as fixed decision points for expansion plan. LT plan expansion decision must select one of the specified bands.

Note that the Max Volume should be entered for expansion to work at expected.

Example:

In the following example, the LT plan is free to select an optimal Max Volume for storage St1 between 0 and 100 TJ. However, for storage St2 the Max Volume after the LT expansion must be either 20TJ, 40TJ, 60TJ, or 90TJ.
