Header: Interface Lines Flow Back Coefficient

Table Details:
Units:	-
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Coefficient of counter-reference direction flow in interface

Paragraphs:
Interface Lines Flow Back Coefficient sets the contribution of line flow in the line's reverse reference direction to flow on the interface.
                When we change this line to have a Flow Back Coefficient, in reference to the Interface , we get a negative value. For example: When we examine the results of the interface above, which considers this L1->3, with Flow Back Coefficient, we see a negative value.
            Note that this property is not available for nodal simulations using the Fixed Shift Factor OPF Method .
