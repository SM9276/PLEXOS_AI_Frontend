Paragraphs:
This setting instructs the Generic
            Writer to produce diagnostic files in an algebraic form, one for
          each optimization problem solved during the simulation.

Algebraic format summarizes the equations in the LP/MIP/QP problem so
          that each unique type of equation is represented by a single
          equation in a semi-algebraic format with its indices and coefficient
          ranges described. The format is not intended to be readable by
          optimization codes and cannot be used to reproduce the original
          optimization problem because it does not contain the full set of
          problem data, however it is useful for documenting the formulation.

Consider the simple three-area system in Figure 1. The data
          associated with this is listed in Tables 1-3.

Figure 1:Example three-area system











The data contained in the CSV files for system load is illustrated in
          Figure 2.

Figure 2: Load Data

If we run a simulation on this system with hourly resolution and
          weekly optimization step the resulting mixed-integer linear
          programming problem contains 15802 constraints, 13778 variables and
          1808 integers and 44081 non-zero coefficients. The printed LP format
          file is 88800 lines long. Although it is possible to read this file it
          is not easy to understand the mathematical formulation in one glance.
          This is the purpose of the Algebraic format.

By contrast, the
          Algebraic format file for this simulation has only 216 lines and is as
          follows:

The algebraic format is formatted similarly to the familiar LP format
          with several sections:

Variables and constraints in the problem are grouped by prefix, which
          is an abbreviation unique to each element. The prefixes form the start
          of the name of every variable and constraint in the LP file. For
          example, the prefix "GenFuel" is the fuel consumption by a generator,
          "LinFlow" is the flow on a transmission line, etc . The
          prefixes begin with a three letter abbreviation for the class the
          element pertains to e.g. "Gen" for Generator, "Lin" for
          Line, "Fue" for Fuel, etc, and are terminated by an underscore.. The
          complete list is in Table 2.



The Comments section at the top of the file describes the original
          problem size.

The Objective Function section begins with one of the keywords minimize or maximize . Each term in the objective function is
          described in the format:

[ c1, c2] Prefix_*{indices}

where:

c1 and c2 are the smallest and largest
          objective function coefficient associated with the variable in the
          original problem respectively

Prefix_ is as described above

{indices} describes the indices for the
          variable and the index ranges applicable

For example the objective function term:

+ [10.5, 16.409569] GenLoad_*{1,…,168}"

refers to the Generator load variable. The "*" denotes where the name
          of each Generator would appear. The indices description "{1,…,168}"
          shows that the variable is indexed between 1 and 168 i.e. there is one
          such variable for each Generator and each hour of a week. The
          coefficient part "+ [10.5, 16.409569]" indicates that the coefficient
          values are all in the range 10.5 - 16.409569.

The constraints section begins with the keywords "Subject To". This
          section lists all the classes of constraint and the variable terms in
          them. This is formatted similarly to the objective function but each
          constraint is also shown with its name and indices, for example:

GenPmax_*{1,…,168}: + GenLoad_*{1,…,168} + [-200, -10] GenOn_*{1,…,168}{1,…,168} + GenFan_*{1,…,3}{1,…,168} (<=,=) [0, 100] w_i  0

The name of the constraint comes first and is separated from the rest
          of the constraint by a colon. In this case the constraint relates to
          the Generator class and is called "Pmax". It is indexed by time
          between 1-168 i.e. for each Generator there are 168 such constraints.
          The terms in the constraint are shown with their indices and
          coefficient ranges. The constraint sense (or direction) is indicated
          by the " (<=,=)" part. In this case it shows that some constraints
          are less-than-or-equal-to and other are equality constraints. Finally
          the right-hand side coefficient range is shown "[0, 100] ", which in
          this case shows that the right-hand-side ranges in value from 0-100.

The Bound section begins with the keyword "Bounds". It lists any
          lower or upper bounds on the variables. Any variable not listed here
          by default has bounds between zero and infinity. The special keyword
          "free" means that a variable has no bounds.

The final two sections are the Generals and Binaries. These sections
          simply list the variables that are general integers (can take any
          integer value between their bounds) or binary variables (must take the
          value zero or one only).

The algebraic format file ends with the keyword "End".
