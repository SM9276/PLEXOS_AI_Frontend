Description:	Number of hours over which generator start costs are amortized

Paragraphs:
MT Schedule Start Cost Amortization Period provides a method for modelling the effect of Generator Start Cost in MT schedule when using the load duration curve method, which does not model unit commitment (start up and shutdown) explicitly.

The amortization period acts as a default when Min Up Time is not defined. The Start Cost is used to create a mark-up to the incremental cost of generation using the following formula:

Start Cost Mark-up = Start Cost / Start Cost Amortization Period x Rating 
This has the effect of penalising units with high start cost.

The reported Start & Shutdown Cost includes this mark-up
