Paragraphs:
Generator Mark-up Point is a load point for use with multi-point Mark-up or Bid-Cost Mark-up . This property controls the breakpoints between bands of mark-up over-riding the default banding behaviour described in the Mark-up property page. Note that mark-up is not applied to generation below Min Stable Level unless the Competition Mark-up Min Stable Level setting is on.

The number of mark-up points (bands) should be one less than the Mark-up bands as the final mark-up band will be extended to the capacity of the generator.

Example:

In the above example a mark-up of $1/ MWh is applied to generation from 40 to 60 MW while $5 is applied above 60 MW.
