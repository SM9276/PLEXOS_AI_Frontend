Paragraphs:
Facility Must Run Units is the
          number of units at the facility that must be committed i.e. a lower
          bound on Units Operating .
          The optimizer is free to commit more than this number of units up to Available Capacity . In the LT Plan, if the input value of Must Run Units is more than the existing number of units, then 
			the Must Run Units will be capped to the existing number of units.

Note that you can set a fixed commitment, rather than a minimum
          commitment use the Commit property, however if Must Run Units is set equal to Units the property
          is converted to Commit automatically.
