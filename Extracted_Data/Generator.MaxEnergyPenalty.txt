Paragraphs:
Generator Max Energy Penalty is the penalty applied to violations of Max
            Energy and Max
            Capacity Factor constraints (and their period-specific
          variants). The default value of -1 makes this a 'hard' constraint.
          Note the unit is $/GWh not $/MWh thus if you want a penalty of
          $10,000/MWh enter the value 10,000,000.
