Description:	Algorithm invoked by the Stochastic Method when a scenario tree is present

Paragraphs:
This setting determines which solution method is employed to solve a
          stochastic optimization in the presence of a scenario tree (as defined
          by a Global object). The available
          methods are:


Lists:
	- Rolling Horizon (value = 0, default): Solves using the Rolling
              Horizon solution method as described in the article Multi-stage
              Stochastic Optimization . This method is the most robust. It
            can handle any level of complexity including integer decision
            variables, non-linear constraints etc and guarantees a fully
            converged solution. In many cases this method is also the fastest to
            execute. However, if you require output of the Future
              Cost Function diagnostic this method will only produce the
            optimal cuts. Choose the SDDP method if you need the full set of
            Benders cuts.
	- Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) (value = 1): Solves
            using the 'traditional' SDDP algorithm. This method performs a
            series of forward and backward passes across the stages of the
            horizon. Benders cuts are developed at each stage representing the
            future cost function and value of storage. Iterations occur until
            convergence criteria are met. This method naturally results in a
            detailed Future Cost
              Function which can be used as input to another simulation e.g. to a short-term ST Schedule with
            the FCF defining the future value of storage.
