Paragraphs:
Generator Mark-up is the absolute
          amount that the generation of the unit is marked up above marginal
          cost. If you prefer to use a relative mark-up, use the property Bid Cost Mark-up . It is
          both an input property (where it sets the mark-up) and an output
          (where the mark-up is reported). Mark-up is multi-band as input and
          output.

The Mark-up property provides a convenient way of applying a simple
          adder to marginal cost without having to define multi-band offers.
          When the generator offer is missing ( i.e. Offer Price and Offer Quantity are not defined) the generator's offers will be based on SRMC plus any defined mark-up. Thus Generator Mark-up affects the order of the generators bidding into the market, but does not form part of its Generation Cost .

Mark-up is multi-band so that mark-ups can change across the range of
          generation. You have the choice of matching the mark-up breakpoints with input Load Points , manually defining
          the breakpoints using Mark-up Point or having the
          simulator create an even set of breakpoints i.e. :

By default, the mark-up is applied only to generation above Min Stable Level . This can
          be changed with the Competition Mark-up MSL attribute.

Examples

In the following examples three generators each of 100MW illustrate
          some of the possible applications of Mark-up:

Notes:

The Mark-up output is defined as:

The latter two terms reflect the marginal effect of Company Strategic constraints and
          Nash-Cournot volume targets respectively.

Generator Mark-up in output is the
          amount of mark-up applied in each band over and above the Cost Price . These mark-ups
          might be input directly (as above) or computed automatically as part
          of a gaming algorithm.

Examples

The input in the above table produce the following output:
Lists:
	- If you define Mark-up Point the simulator
            will use this to define the breakpoints;
	- otherwise if you define Load Point and provide the
            same number of bands of Mark-up then the simulator will match the
            mark-up to the load points.
	- otherwise if you provide more or less bands of Mark-up than load
            point (or do not define load point at all) the simulator will divide
            the normal generation range into even sized bands and apply the
            defined mark-ups.
	- "U1" defines a $2.00 mark-up which will be applied uniformly across
            its normal generating range of 40-100MW.
	- "U2" defines a 10-band mark-up but because it does not also define Load Point in 10 bands,
            PLEXOS will divides the range 40-100MW in 10 bands each of 6MW and
            apply the 10-band mark-ups. Note that you can still use load points
            here to define the heat rate function.
	- "U3" defines a heat rate function using three bands and also
            provides three bands for Mark-up. Thus PLEXOS will match the mark-up
            breakpoints to the load points, but exclude the first 40MW from
            being marked up (unless the above mentioned setting is changed).
	- Mark-ups will be cleared in cost order. There is currently no
            equivalent to the option Offers Must Clear in Order for Mark-ups. If you require offers that are non-convex in nature
            then set this option and use Offer Quantity and Offer Price .
	- PLEXOS provides a Competition attribute for automatically adding in
            a No Load Cost Mark-up to generator offers i.e. to compensate for the difference
            between marginal and average cost.
