Paragraphs:
The Purchaser Max Energy, and the period-specific variants, defines a upper bound on the Purchaser's Load on an hourly , daily , weekly , monthly , or annual basis.

Example :

A purchaser may be defined with periodic limits on the purchaser's energy like this:

Note the use of Max Energy Month variant and timeslices (patterns) to change the energy limits by each month of the year.

The simulator converts the energy constraints into Constraint objects. By default the constraints are hard i.e. no violation is allowed. If you prefer to allow violations then use the Max Energy Penalty property.

Please note: The interval data type for these properties is not supported.
