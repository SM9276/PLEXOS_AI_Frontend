Description:	Level of detail used in transmission modelling in LT Plan.

Paragraphs:
LT Plan Transmission Detail controls the level of detail that the transmission network is modelled in LT Plan.

The attribute can take these values:

The transmission network is modelled only to the Region level with all resources inside the region connected to a single notional node. Only links between regions are modelled and a transportation algorithm computes the flows.

The full transmission network is modelled to nodal level and the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is computed. Zonal (value = 2) The transmission network is modelled only to the Zone level with all resources inside the zone connected to a single notional node. Only links between zones are modelled and a transportation algorithm computes flows. Nodes that are not associated with a Zone are included as 'zones' by themselves.
