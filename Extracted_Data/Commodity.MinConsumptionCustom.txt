Paragraphs:
Commodity Min Consumption Custom
          creates a Constraint object that
          forces the Consumption of
          the Commodity over a custom time frame. By default this is a 'hard'
          constraint. To create a soft constraint, set the Min
            Consumption Penalty property.
