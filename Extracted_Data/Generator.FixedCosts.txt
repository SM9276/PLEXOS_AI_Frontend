Paragraphs:
Generator Fixed Costs is the
          total fixed costs. It's definition depends on the simulation phase:

Fixed Costs = FO&M Cost + Annualized Build
                Cost + time × ∑ ( b ) ( Fixed
                Charge b × 1000 × Installed
                Capacity ) x (1 - Tax Rate )

Fixed Costs = FO&M Cost + Debt Cost + Equity
                Cost + time × ∑ ( b ) ( Fixed
                Charge b × 1000 × Installed
                Capacity )

Note that when LT Plan is run
              prior to MT Schedule or ST
                Schedule the Annualized
                Build Cost is converted automatically to Debt
                Charge and Equity
                Charge with an arbitrary 50/50 ratio. This pass-through
              ensures that Fixed Costs in those phases accounts for Build
                Cost and thus can be accounted for in reporting as well as
              in Equilibrium Model = "LRMC/Revenue Recovery" (and hence market prices can reflect
              build costs).
