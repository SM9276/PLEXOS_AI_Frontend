Paragraphs:
Market Buy Block defines the period
          over which the option is exercised. Use the default value of 0 to turn
          off the option, or a 1 to indicate the option is available. Quantities
          exercised are even over the period up to the Max
            Purchases . Set the Buy Unit property to a value to exercise the option in discrete blocks.

Example

In the following example, purchases must be made in 5 MW blocks up to
          a limit of 100 MW.

The duration of the block purchase can be changed from every interval
          to hour, day, week, month or year using the appropriate period-type
          version of Buy Block.

Example

In the following example, the purchase decision is made once per day,
          and if made the 5 MW blocks accepted must be taken in every hour of
          each day.

To use a profiled option over the course of a day, week, month, or
          year; combine the derivative version of Buy Block, and configure Max
          Purchases to represent the pattern. In order to be exercised
          appropriately, the step size in ST Schedule must be set long enough to
          include the option period, and if the discreet option size is used,
          MIP must be selected as this becomes an integer problem. (Note
          selecting rounded relaxation or LP, will not always result in discreet
          block sizes)

Example

In the following example the purchase quantity is profiled according
          to the Timeslice objects "HLH" and
          "LLH". This profiling is intra-day, though the block purchase decision
          is made once-per-day.
