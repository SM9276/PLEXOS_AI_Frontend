Paragraphs:
Vehicle Demand is the hourly travel demand
            for a vehicle expressed in km (metric) or miles (Imperial US).
            Demand is typically defined as a time series read from a Data
            File and connected to a Variable so that stochastics can be applied. Thus, although it can define
            discrete travel 'events' it is best thought of as the 'expected
            value' of travel demand in any period. The total demand applied is
            equal to the Demand input multiplied by the number of Units (number of vehicles).

Note that, if you define the Fixed
            Load input then the Demand input is ignored.
