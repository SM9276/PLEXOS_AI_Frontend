Description:	Number of Commodity 'units' where zero switches the Commodity out of the simulation

Paragraphs:
Commodity Units is the number
              of 'units' of the Commodity modeled where 0 means the Commodity is
              excluded from the simulation. Use this property to toggle the
              Commodity in/out of your simulation by tagging the Units property
              with a Scenario . Values of Units
              greater than 1 scale up the storage and constraints related to the
              Commodity i.e. Max
                Inventory , Max
                Consumption , Max
                Production , etc .
