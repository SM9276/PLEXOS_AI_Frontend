Paragraphs:
Generator Regulation Range is the range, starting at Regulation Point , over which the unit can provide regulation reserve i.e. the AGC range.

Example:

In this example the generator can operate between 300 and 600 MW for energy, but can only provide regulation reserve when in the range 400 to 550.

Note: For running time considerations, this feature is only compatible with one regulation reserve or multiple regulation reserves that are not mutually exclusive.
