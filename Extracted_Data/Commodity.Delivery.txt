Paragraphs:
Commodity Delivery is the
              amount of the Commodity added to inventory in each period from an
              external source. This can be either a rate of 'inflow' to the
              inventory (when Commodity Unit
                Type = "Rate") or set quantities ( Commodity Unit Type = "Quantity"). In
              the latter case the delivery appears each simulation period and so
              the total delivered over a set time period scales up/down with the Horizon Periods
                per Day . For example, if Delivery = 10 and the interval
              length is one hour then the total delivery in a day would be 240
              regardless of the Unit Type setting, but if the interval length is 24 hours the total delivery
              would be 240 for the "Rate" setting and 10 for the "Quantity"
              setting.

Commodity Delivery is the
              amount of the Commodity added to inventory in each period from an
              external source as defined in input.
