Paragraphs:
Constraint Conditions RHS Coefficient provides a means of adding a constant to the right-hand side of the constraint when a given Variable is active.

Example:

In this example the Condition "A ONLINE" is active when the Generator "A" is on-line (committed), and this in turn adds 100 MW to the Constraint "1->2 MAX", which set a dynamic limit on the flow on Line "1->2".
