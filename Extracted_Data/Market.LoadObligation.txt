Paragraphs:
Market Load Obligation is the assumed contribution of the market sales to 'load' for capacity reserves calculations in LT Plan . By default the Max Sales is an assumed 'obligation' and counted as an 'export' in the Region Net Capacity Interchange . You may override this by setting Load Obligation directly.

Example

In the following example the Max Sales is 100 MW, but only 50 MW need be counted as an 'obligation' for capacity calculations.
