Header: Performance Presolve

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	True (-1)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	Toggles on/off solver presolve

Paragraphs:
This option toggles on/off use of the solver's presolve algorithm.
          Presolve performs eliminations and substitutions on the original
          problem in order to reduce the problem size. The presolve should be
          left on for most applications, however turning off the presolve can
          speed up the SDDP algorithm which solves many small problems in parallel.
