Paragraphs:
Interface Limit Penalty is used to make the limit on interface flows 'soft' i.e. the limit can be violated at a unit cost equal to the penalty price. The violation incurred is reported in the Violation and Violation Back properties.

Note that this penalty appears in the optimization's objective function, thus if a violation occurs the penalty price will affect the locational marginal prices and rents generated on the interface.
