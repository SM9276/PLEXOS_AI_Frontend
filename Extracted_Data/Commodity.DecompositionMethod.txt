Paragraphs:
Commodity Decomposition Method
          controls the way the simulator decomposes the optimal LT
            Plan or MT Schedule inventory profile (the sequence of Closing
            Inventory values in time) down to ST
            Schedule . Decomposition is generally required only for
          inventories that are large enough that they do not attain their limits
          within a single step of ST Schedule .
          This switch takes the following values:

where:

The size of the bands is controlled by the following power function:

	- For any method other than "None" and when using partial
            chronology, it is preferred, but not required, that the LT
              Plan LDC Type or MT
              Schedule LDC Type is at
            least the resolution of the Horizon Chrono Step Type e.g. if ST Schedule is running with
            day-sized steps (look-ahead included) then the preceding phase
            should use a day resolution. If the preceding phase runs a coarser
            resolution such as week then the targets created could violate
            inventory limits. To compensate for this resolution mismatch
            penalties are introduced on the storage bounds according to the Decomposition
              Bound Penalty property. This does not apply to chronological LT Plan or MT
              Schedule .
	- Decomposition Method = "Targets" creates a penalty function around
            the decomposed profile so that variations are allowed in ST
              Schedule without creating infeasibilities in the target
            constraints. The penalty function is a piece-wise linear function
            that penalizes under-reaching of the target but not over-reaching.
            The function has 10 bands and the price in each band is based on a
            multiple of the Shadow Price calculated in MT Schedule thus:
	- a is Commodity Decomposition
              Penalty a
	- b is Commodity Decomposition
              Penalty b
	- c is Commodity Decomposition
              Penalty c
	- x is Commodity Decomposition
              Penalty x
