Paragraphs:
Gas Plant Max Production Day is the maximum daily production of gas.

Note: The Gas Plant Max Production input always needs to be defined for the Gas Plant to operate. If there is no restriction on the Max Production per interval, setting a more permissive value for the Max Production input will allow the Gas Plant to operate and this constraint will be more restrictive.
