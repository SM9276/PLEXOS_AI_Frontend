Description:	Maximum fuel offtake per interval

Paragraphs:
As input Fuel Max Offtake is the
          maximum amount of fuel allowed to be used in any interval of the
          simulation.

For multi-period limits see the following properties:

These limits are treated as hard constraints, meaning that the
          simulation cannot use any more fuel than is specified by the limit at
          any price. To model soft constraints, you can set the Max Offtake Penalty . You can also use use a generic Constraint or a Fuel Contract to model soft constraints.

As output Fuel Max Offtake is the
            maximum Offtake in the period.
