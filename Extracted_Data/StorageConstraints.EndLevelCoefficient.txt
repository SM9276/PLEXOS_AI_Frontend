Description:	Coefficient of storage end level.

Paragraphs:
Storage Constraints End Level Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient on the storage End Level . This coefficient is
          usually used in defining storage target constraints.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × Storage End Level ... {≤,
            ≥, =} b j
