Paragraphs:
Fuel Constraints In Use Coefficient is Boolean value (1 if the Fuel is in use, 0 otherwise). You can use this coefficient to place constraints on combinations of fuels used by a Generator when you also add filtering memberships of Generator objects into the Generators collection.

Example

Generator "X" uses Fuels "A", "B", "C", "D":

Only the combinations "AB" and "CD" are valid. All other combinations must be excluded. To model this we formulate the following constraints:
