Description:	Generic writer will standardize names in LP and SOL files

Paragraphs:
This option is used with the Generic Writer .

The different solvers use different standards for variable naming.  For example, a variable name "Coal Gen", CPLEX will replace the white space with an underscore character.  This means that LP files written by one solver may not be read correctly using a different solver (e.g. CPLEX).  When this option is enabled the Generic Writer standardizes the constraint and variable names.  The following characters are replaced with an underscore character:
