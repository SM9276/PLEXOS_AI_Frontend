Paragraphs:
Gas Demand Shortage Level is used to specify tiered bands with different Shortage Price values. The levels are specified in cumulative amounts and are 
            scaled based on the Gas Demand Resolution. If all the bands are used up PLEXOS will still allow more shortage to occur at the 
            shortage price of the last band.
