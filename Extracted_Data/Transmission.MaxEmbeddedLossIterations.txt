Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	2
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Description:	Maximum number of iterations for removing embedded losses from load.

Paragraphs:
Transmission Max Embedded Loss Iterations sets how many iterations are used to account for (remove) transmission losses that are embedded in the input load.

Refer to the article Loss Modeling for details of how these embedded losses are handled.
