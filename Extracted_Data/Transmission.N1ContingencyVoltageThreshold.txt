Header: Transmission N-1 Contingency Voltage Threshold

Table Details:
Units:	kV
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Description:	Voltage level at which N-1 contingencies are automatically enforced.

Paragraphs:
Transmission N-1 Contingency Voltage Threshold sets the voltage level for transmission Lines and Transformers for which N-1 contingency case would be added to SCUC once Enforce N-1 Contingencies is turned on. N-1 contingency case will not be added if element voltage is below this level. This parameter allows user to reduce the number of contingency cases and so improve performance.
