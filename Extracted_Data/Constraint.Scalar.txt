Description:	Scale the constraint by dividing left and right hand sides by this factor

Paragraphs:
Constraint Scalar, when set to a
          value other than the default of one, scales the constraint by dividing
          left and right hand sides by this factor. This does not affect the
          meaning of the constraint, but can help in cases where the input
          values of the coefficients and right hand-side are very large or very
          small. In this case, it can be advantageous to rescale them so that
          the coefficients are all of magnitude 1e-3 to 1e+3.
