Paragraphs:
Emission Generators Allocation defines a per interval allocation of emissions to the generator in the form of a Grandfather Right. This allocation of emissions is discounted from the calculated Cost . The resulting change in Net Profit will affect the way the company bids in LRMC (Revenue Recovery) mode.

If this property is defined for an Emission which also has any Company Emission Allocation variant defined, this value will be ignored and the later will be used. If this property is defined for an Emission which has a membership with a Company then this Allocation value will be migrated to Company Emission Allocation .
