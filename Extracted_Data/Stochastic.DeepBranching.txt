Description:	For Rolling Horizon this is the level of additional branching after the end of regular branching

Paragraphs:
Stochastic Deep Branching applies to the Rolling Horizon method for
          solving multi-stage stochastic optimization - see MT
            Schedule Stochastic
            Algorithm .

During iterations of the Rolling Horizon, branching in the scenario
          tree occurs up to a given number of stages (weeks/months) ahead. That
          number of stages is controlled by the Minimum
            Sample Weight setting. In the following example, branching
          occurs for six stages ahead each roll (iteration) of the solution
          method:

After six stages branching ceases for that iteration i.e. each full branch is deterministic from that stage onward. When the
          next roll (iteration) begins a further six stages of branching are
          added and so on as the algorithm rolls through the horizon.

Deep branching allows for additional branching after the regular
          branching ceases. The default value of zero means no additional
          branching. Values above zero space additional branching at factors of
          2 from the end of regular branching. For example, Deep Branching = 4
          results in additional branching 2, 4, 8 and 16 stages after regular
          branching. Deep Branching improves the ability of Rolling Horizon to
          'look-ahead' and may improve solutions in cases where the system is
          highly sensitive to the stochastic variables e.g. systems
          with a high dependency on hydro.
