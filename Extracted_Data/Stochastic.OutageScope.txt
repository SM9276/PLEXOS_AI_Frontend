Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	In (0,1,2,3)
Description:	Scope of preschedule outage pattern generator.

Paragraphs:
Stochastic Outage Scope switches automatically generated random (forced) outages and distributed maintenance on/off. It can take the following values:

Note:
Lists:
	- The algorithm used to produce these outages is controlled by the Monte Carlo Method option.
	- Discrete Maintenance is always included in the simulation. If you want to turn off discrete maintenance, scenario the Units Out data out of the Model .
