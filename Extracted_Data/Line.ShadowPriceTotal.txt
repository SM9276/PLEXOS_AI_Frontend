Paragraphs:
Line Shadow Price Total is the shadow price on the Line thermal limit as defined by Max Flow (and optionally Min Flow . This shadow price is derived directly from the dual solution to the mathematical programming problem used to solve the simulation. It can be interpreted as the economic benefit of relaxing the Line limit constraint by one megawatt.
