Description:	End of month vehicle stored energy target

Paragraphs:
Vehicle Energy Target Month is the end of month stored energy target. Energy Target Month adds a constraint on the Vehicle's energy level at the end of each month.

Vehicle SoC must be formulated for it
                to be constrained. This property is therefore only valid with detailed Vehicle models (those defining energy storage properties such as Capacity and Efficiency ). Detailed and simple vehicle models are described in Vehicle .
