Header: PLEXOS PSSE Import Options

Table Details:

Paragraphs:
The PSSE, or PTI, options can be seen in the following screenshot.

The naming convention for these options are as follows:

The naming convention for these options are as follows:

The naming convention is essentially the same as the "US" option, but this format uses additional Excel (xls or xlsx) files for data definitions and object mapping. The differences are as follows:

Note: This option has been implemented for specific US clients. If further information is required then please contact support.

	- Nodes: The name is taken directly from the comments in the raw file (/**/).
	- Regions: The regions are red as is, except for the CASIO region which is split into sub-regions - "PGAE", "SCE", "SDGE", and "VEA"
	- Interfaces: the interface names are read from a xls file called "MPDATA_Interface_Definitions". The memberships and properties for these interfaces are directly extracted from the "MPDATA_Interface_Limits" file.
	- Contingencies: These are imported directly from a file called "MPDATA_Contingency"
