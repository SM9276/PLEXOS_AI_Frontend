Paragraphs:
Load Load is used to specify the real power (MW) rating of the load. Loads can be defined separately at a node. In other words, loads belonging to different companies can be assigned to the same node. For example, Load_1 served by Company_1, Load_2 and Load_3 served by Company_2 can each be assigned individually to Node_1.

The following example shows how to input the MW load data at a node using Load .

The user can directly enter the load values as shown above or specify the loads using the Load Participation Factor property. Note: When Load is used to set Loads the property Is Scalable must be set as No for the Load to be enabled.

The total load at a node is the sum of all individual loads connected to the node.
