Paragraphs:
This property applies to all outage facilities such as Generator , Line , Gas Pipeline . It controls the interaction between Forced Outage Rate and planned maintenance defined with Units Out . By default Forced Outage Rate is interpreted as the mean percentage of all hours of the year that the facility is unexpectedly out-of-service. Switching this parameter to true changes this interpretation to be the percentage of in-service hours rather than all hours.

For example, if one defines the following properties:

By default the unit is expected to be forced out for 0.1 × 8760 = 876 hours in the year. With the parameter toggled to true the unit is expected out 0.1 × (8760 - 92 × 24) = 655.2 hours, the difference being the amount of time on scheduled maintenance.
