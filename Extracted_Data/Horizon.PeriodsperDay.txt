Paragraphs:
Horizon Periods per Day allows the
          simulator to model any feasible number of intervals per simulated day.
          The default is 24-periods-per-day (hourly) simulation. The values
          allowed are shown in the following table:

Values above 24 are referred to as "sub-hourly", while values above
          1440 are referred to as "sub-minute" resolution.

Data Files read into the
          simulation need not have the same number of periods-per-day as this
          setting. If, for example, the data file contains hourly data, but
          Periods per Day is set to 288 (5-minute) then the simulator will
          upscale the data automatically. Likewise, data of higher resolution
          will be scaled down automatically.

The setting Compression
            Factor allows you to run the simulation at a lower resolution
          but still output data to the solution file in the original resolution.
