Description:	Scale the objective function internally by this factor

Paragraphs:
Scaling the objective function by a uniform value does not change the
          optimal solution, but can improve solver performance.Â  If your
          objective function is in the order of 1e+8 or higher then setting
          Objective Scalar = 1e+3 will scale down the objective to the range to
          1e+5 which is likely to improve performance. Note that this scaling
          factor is only used inside the solver and is 'undone' when the
          solution is reported.
