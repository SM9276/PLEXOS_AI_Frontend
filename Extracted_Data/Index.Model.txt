Header: Model Index

Table Details:
Enabled	Yes/No	0	In (0,-1)	If the model is ready to be executed
Execution Order	-	0	≥0	Order in which to execute the Model when running in a batch.
Load Custom Assemblies	Yes/No	-1	In (0,-1)	If the Model should run custom OpenPLEXOS assemblies.
Make Unique Name	-	0	In (-1,0,1)	If model output should be written to a unique filename for each execution
Objective Absolute Tolerance	-	0	≥0	Allowable degradation for the objective when doing hierarchical multi-objective optimization for MIP models
Objective Priority	-	1	≥0	Priority of the objective when doing hierarchical multi-objective optimization
Objective Relative Tolerance	-	0	Between 0 And 1	Allowable relative degradation for the objective when doing hierarchical multi-objective optimization for MIP models
Objective Weight	-	1		Weight of the objective when doing blended multi-objective optimization
Output to Folder	Yes/No	-1	In (0,-1)	If model output should be written to a folder under the source directory, or into the source folder itself
Random Number Seed	-	0	Between 0 And 2147483647	Random number seed for this model
Run Mode	-	0	In (0,1)	Switches between Normal and Dry run modes
Write Input	Yes/No	0	In (0,-1)	If Model input should be written to the output location along with the solution.
Read Order	-	False	0	≥0	False	Order in which to read scenario data (last read scenario has highest priority)
