Paragraphs:
Line Export Cost is the cost of energy exported. It is a component of Rental when the Transmission Rental Method = "Point to Point" and is calculated as:

Please note that the loss component in above equation is only considered when transmission loss modelling is enabled.

The costs are considering the price of the energy and the losses at the origin: When the line is exporting , the energy flows from the Node From to the Node To. Therefore, Export Cost = Flow × Price @ Node From When the line is importing , the energy flows from Node To to Node From. Therefore, Import Cost = Flow × Price @ Node To
