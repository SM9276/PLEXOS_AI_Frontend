Paragraphs:
Error and warning messages produced during the simulation are listed in the following table. In addition to these messages:

For help on any type of error or warning you may contact Energy Exemplar support .


Lists:
	- A simulation may produce errors or warnings directly from the mathematical programming solver employed.
	- Infeasibilities may occur and be repaired (noted in the log file) or fail to repair (result in a fatal error).
