Table Details:

Multi-band:	False

Key Property:	No
Description:	Vehicle can charge and discharge simultaneously

Paragraphs:
If defined, Vehicle Simultaneous Charge and Discharge overrides the global Production Pump and Generate setting. Simultaneous charging and discharging is allowed or prevented as specified.

If preventing simultaneous charging and discharging, note that linear Unit Commitment Optimality will relax
                the integer restrictions underpinning the prevention. Any unit commitment optimality except linear is therefore recommended when preventing
                simultaneous charging and discharging. Unit commitment optimality can be defined via Production Unit Commitment Optimality .
