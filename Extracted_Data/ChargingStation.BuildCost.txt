Paragraphs:
Charging Station Build Cost
          is the 'overnight cost' of building a charging station unit in LT
            Plan . The Build Cost can be defined in combination with Economic
            Life and WACC so that LT Plan computes an annuity as described
          in the article LT Plan . If Build Cost
          is defined without these parameters then the entire Build Cost is
          incurred in the period the unit is built.
