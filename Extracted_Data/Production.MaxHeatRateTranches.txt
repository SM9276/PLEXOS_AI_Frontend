Description:	Maximum number of tranches in the fuel function piecewise linear approximation

Paragraphs:
Production Max Heat Rate
          Tranches is the maximum number of tranches used in the fitting of the
          piecewise linear function to the Generator marginal heat rate. See the article Heat
            Rate Modelling for details.

You can also limit the number of tranches used with the Min
            Heat Rate Tranche Size setting.
