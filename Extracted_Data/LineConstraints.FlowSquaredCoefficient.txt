Description:	Coefficient of square of line flow

Paragraphs:
Line Constraints Flow Squared Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient on the
          square of the Line Flow in the constraint.

This constraint term is intended for use in generic transmission
          constraints where the square of flow (on a line other than that in the
          constraint) forms a part of the limit. See Generator Constraints Generation
            Squared Coefficient for more details and an example.

NOTE : Constraints including dynamically evaluated
          terms like this cannot be used as Definition constraints for a Decision
            Variable .
