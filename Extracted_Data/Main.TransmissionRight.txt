Description:	Transmission right (FTR, SRA)

Paragraphs:
See also Transmission Right Property Reference for a detailed list of properties for
          this class of object.

PLEXOS supports two styles of transmission right using the Transmission Right class:

FTR and SRA settlement will appear as additional contract revenue to the generating or purchasing company owner-equal to
        the difference in nodal prices multiplied by the contract quantity. Note that these monies will also affect dynamic bidding
        when using Cost Recovery and LRMC since they will partially offset fixed cost and
        other revenue requirements.
Lists:
	- Add the transmission nodes acting as the 'from' and 'to' nodes in the FTR to the Node From and Node To collections of the Transmission Right respectively.
	- Set the Companies that own the FTR-you may use the property to split the
            settlement of the FTR among multiple companies.
	- Set the Quantity equal to the MW quantity of the FTR.
	- Add the line or lines whose surpluses ( Rental ) are the subject of the SRA.
	- Set the Companies that own the FTR-you may use the property to split the
            settlement of the FTR among multiple companies.
