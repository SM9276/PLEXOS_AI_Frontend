The user can use Load if loads served by
          different companies are present at a node. For example, if at Node_1,
          Load_1 is served by Company_1, and Load_2 is served by Company 2, then Load should be used. If the user chooses
          to input load data using Load , then the Region feature is disabled internally
          by PLEXOS.
