Paragraphs:
Generator Outage Pump Load is the load drawn by a unit in pumping mode when an outage of the given type (band) occurs. This is the pumping analog of the Outage Rating property.

Example

In the following example there are two 'types' of outage defined:

NOTE : Be default a generation outage defined either by Units Out or by setting Rating to zero will result in zero pumping. This can be overridden by setting the Outage Pump Load alone as in the following example:
Lists:
	- A partial generation that also de-rates the pumping load
	- A full generation outage that does not affect the pumping load
