Paragraphs:
Fuel Units is a binary flag indicating if the fuel exists or not. By default, Fuel objects are available (Units = 1), but by setting Units = 0 you can make the Fuel unavailable.

It is important to note that any Generator associated with Fuel objects that are all unavailable will also be unavailable. Also note that Units may be a dynamic property i.e. change value in time so that a Fuel changes availability during the simulation.

Example

In the following example the Fuel "Oil" is available unless the running Model includes the "No Oil" Scenario .
