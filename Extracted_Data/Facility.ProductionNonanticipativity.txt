Facility Production
          Non-anticipativity applies to multi-sample simulations with the Stochastic
            Method "Stochastic" i.e. stochastic optimization
          using scenario-wise decomposition. It is used to identify the
          non-anticipative Production decisions, and can optionally be set in combination with Production
            Non-anticipativity Time .

Defining the property adds the following constraints to the
          formulation:

Production ( s , t ) = Production ( s +1, t ) âˆ€ s < S

where: s is the sample number S = Stochastic Risk Sample Count

The property can take any value, but there are two special cases to
          consider:

The property is commonly used in medium or long-term Rolling
            Horizon models to ensure that Production decisions do not
          anticipate future information e.g. hydro inflows. Note that
          is generally not necessary to define this for the SDDP stochastic algorithm.



For the example in Table 1 Facility "A" Production is a
          non-anticipative (or first-stage in a two-stage stochastic
          optimization) decision for the first 12 hours and a recourse
          (second-stage) decision after that time, whereas Facility "B" is a
          non-anticipative decision for all periods but with a penalty of
          $10,000 if the constraint is violated.
