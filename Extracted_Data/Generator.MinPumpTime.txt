Paragraphs:
Generator Min Pump Time, for a pumped storage generator , is
          the minimum number of hours a unit runs when in pump mode. This
          property is used in combination with Min
            Pump Load and triggers the formulation of pump-mode unit
          commitment, analogous to Min Up
            Time and Min Stable
            Level . You may optionally define Initial
            Hours Pumping .
