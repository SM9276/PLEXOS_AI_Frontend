Paragraphs:
See also Performance Property
            Reference for a detailed list of properties for this class of
          object.

Performance objects control various settings related to the
          mathematical programming solver engine used to execute the problems
          generated by the simulator. To apply a Performance object to your
          Model add it to the Model's
            Performance collection. Note that associating the object with a Model defines the global settings, but
          you can optionally associate it with individual simulation phases e.g. LT Plan to run different settings in
          different phases of your simulation.

You may also set more detailed solver parameters by using a Solver
            Parameters File .
