Paragraphs:
Gas Pipeline Constraints Units Retired Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient in the
          constraint of the binary (0,1) variable indicating if the Gas
            Pipeline is retired to date.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation.
