Description:	Penalty applied to non-physical discharging of the vehicle. A value of -1 means none is allowed.

Paragraphs:
Vehicle Non-physical Discharge Penalty is the penalty applied to non-physical discharging of the vehicle. Non-physical discharging is
                analogous to Dump Energy : energy reducing SoC but not appearing elewhere in the system (i.e. tyre rotations, servicing load through V2G etc.). A value of -1 means none is allowed. Other values cause non-physical discharging variables to be formulated, priced at the supplied value.

Non-physical charge and discharge penalties do not represent physical system capability. They are primarily diagnostic tools (i.e. diagnosis and correction of infeasibilities).

If Unserved Energy is allowed , non-physical penalties should
                be priced above the cost of USE ( VoLL ). A value of 10x VoLL is a useful starting point.

Non-physical charging and discharging is reported in Vehicle Non-physical Charge Adjustments and Vehicle Non-physical Discharge Adjustments respectively.
