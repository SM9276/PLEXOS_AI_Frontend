Paragraphs:
Check out the powerful new Facility Cloning feature available from the Desktop Config to self-document new and existing universal models. Create as many
                versions of the Facility class as desired with custom object and property names to model everything from an ammonia plant to a bin packing operation, all within PLEXOS.
                In addition, in PLEXOS 10 the connection between universal classes and other standard objects has been expanded with new input properties on the memberships
                between Facilities and Nodes, Gas Nodes, Heat Nodes, and Water Nodes. These include properties to specify a consumption, production, and units
                coefficient, and they coincide with additional Facility output properties for electric, gas, heat, and water production and revenue. More granular
                consumption modeling has also been added for Facility with input properties Consumption, Consumption Incr, Consumption Incr2, and Consumption Incr3.
                The Commodity Intrinsic property also makes it easy to connect a Commodity with the electric, gas, heat, or water network constraints.

PLEXOS 10 includes many new constraints for the modeling of hydrogen production with Power2Xs and Gas Plants. There are over a dozen new Power2X input
                properties that enable the modeling of ramp rates, a repair time distribution, power degradation, and capital cost recovery. Start and shutdown profiles
                can now also be applied to Power2X objects in addition to different cooling states. Similarly, many new Gas Plant input properties have been added to model
                ramp rates, start and shutdown profiles, and cooling states.

Significant enhancements have been made to the Gas Transport class to facilitate an improved representation of LNG shipments. The ability to make Gas Transport
                objects expansion candidates has been added with expansion input properties such as Expansion Max Volume, Retirement Transport, Build Cost, and Economic Life.
                Maintenance and forced outage functionalities have also been added to Gas Transport objects with new inputs such as Maintenance Rate, Maintenance Frequency,
                Forced Outage Rate, and Mean Time to Repair. Additional cost inputs are also now available on the Gas Transport object including Charter Rate, Port Fees, and
                Canal Fees. These numerous new inputs also come with the standard associated output properties.

A new nodal feature has been added in PLEXOS 10 to improve performance while decreasing the injection mismatch that happens due to a nonzero Flow PTDF threshold. This
                is specifically for modeling large networks using Fixed Shift Factor with constraints not formulated up front. In that case when the input Commitment PTDF Threshold is
                greater than the Flow PTDF threshold, PLEXOS will simplify the unit commitment problem to only use the PTDFs of magnitude greater than this input value. This can
                significantly reduce the time it takes to solve for the commitment. Once the commitment problem has been solved, a final set of iterations is performed with all PTDFs
                to ensure that no flow violations remain and that the injection mismatches are minimized.

Contingencies can now be easily screened within a standard ST simulation to determine which lines and transformers have post-contingent flows with limit violations. Use
                the Contingency Screening Elements input and Line/Transformer Screening Mode input to control which flow elements are screened. PLEXOS will calculate the post-contingent flows
                and keep track of all potential violations for the screened elements. The simulation will produce a list of contingency/monitored element pairs that can then easily be
                imported to activate as constraints in subsequent simulations.

A new Node output property AC Mismatch is a significant new feature which provides a stress metric on the nodal solve to understand its compatibility with an AC
                powerflow. When enabled, after each step an advanced calculation is performed to determine the mismatch between the current DC solution and an AC solve for each node. New input
                properties associated with this feature include AC Line Charging Susceptance on Line; AC Reactive Power and AC Voltage Magnitude on Node; and AC Fixed Shift Angle, AC
                Line Charging Susceptance, and AC Tap Ratio on Transformer.

In addition to the already existing citygate gas tracking logic to report delivered prices at Gas Nodes and delivered quantities between gas sources and sinks,
                delivered emissions outputs have also been added. This includes 24 additional Delivered Emissions outputs between Fuel, Gas Demand, Gas Storage, and Generator (sinks)
                and Gas Contracts, Gas Fields, Gas Plants, Gas Storages, Gas Transports, and Power2Xs. These new outputs provide a powerful way to track the emissions within a gas system.

PLEXOS 10 includes a new welcome screen with quick access to cloud studies and recent simulations. Quickly find and clone a
                cloud study to download the data directly to the desktop. Or get a link to easily see the simulation history and solutions in a browser.

The current solver versions are shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Solver versions supported in the 10.0 release of PLEXOS.

The API has changes which will allow users to safely use the API on older versions of PLEXOS Datasets and Solutions.
                The changes are mostly backwards compatible. Function signatures which formerly accepted Enum types now accept integer IDs.
                The old Enum types are still accepted, but in Python they need to be cast to integers. To ensure the API works on older versions
                of databases, however, there are functions to fetch the class, collection and property IDs from the database rather than
                relying on Enum values. See Automation .

Short duration Batteries and Storages in Sampled Chronology now
                have freely optimized Initial SoC / Initial Volume . This change generally improves the
                robustness and optimality of small storage utilization. It also removes the potential for model sensitivity to relatively minor parameters such as the
                starting hour of the Planning Horizon . See Initial SoC / Initial Volume .

This version will automatically upgrade any previous Version 8. x or 9. x database. You may need to check the upgrade notes of earlier releases for any compatibility issues.

If you experience any problems upgrading or your simulations run differently or slower in this version during upgrade contact Energy Exemplar Support.

The new attributes in this release are listed in Table 2.
