Paragraphs:
Generator Max Capacity defines
          the nominal (generator-terminal) rating of the generating units in
          megawatts.

This value defines the Installed
            Capacity and is used to calculate annual fixed cost charges such
          as F&OM Cost as well as Build Cost . Thus if you need to
          de-rate a unit periodically do not change the value of the
          max capacity because altering this value will alter the fixed cost
          calculation - instead, use the Rating or Rating Factor property.
