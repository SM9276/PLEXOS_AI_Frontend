Description:	Provision of lower (spin down) reserve

Paragraphs:
Vehicle Lower Reserve is the
          provision of lower ('spin down') reserve summed over all lower reserve types (lower and regulation lower).
          Lower reserve is provided by reserving some Charging capability to the battery when the SoC is below Max SoC or by offering to
          reduce Discharging from the
          battery. This is allowed only when the Vehicle is connected to
          Charging Stations providing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services i.e. when Charging Station Max
            Discharge Rate is non-zero.
