Paragraphs:
Storage Trajectory
          Non-anticipativity is the penalty applied to violation of the
          'non-anticipativity' constraints - those that force the storage
          release decisions across multiple samples to be identical i.e. that prevent the optimization from anticipating the Natural
            Inflow . The default value of -1 means the constraints are hard i.e. the same storage trajectory decision must be made for all samples.

For all stochastic optimization problems, except SDDP ,
          defining the property adds the following constraints to the
          formulation:

End
            Volume ( s , t ) = End
            Volume ( s +1, t ) âˆ€ s < S

where: s is the sample number S = Stochastic Risk Sample Count

For SDDP , setting
          this property to-1 simply indicates that this is a stochastic storage.

This property can be defined in combination with Trajectory
            Non-anticipativity Volume to define a multi-band function.

Note that the units of Trajectory Non-anticipativity are $/ MWh while Trajectory
            Non-anticipativity Volume is in units of storage ( e.g. GWh , CMD, AF) and thus internally a
          conversion is made for this penalty to units of storage and this is
          done by using either Downstream
            Efficiency or if that is not defined then by computing the Potential
            Energy .
