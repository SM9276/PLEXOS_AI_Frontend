Paragraphs:
Gas Storage Constraints End Volume Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient on the
          storage End Volume . This
          coefficient is usually used in defining storage target constraints.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:
