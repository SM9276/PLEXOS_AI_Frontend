Paragraphs:
Commodity Min Withdrawal Hours
          creates a Constraint object that
          forces the Withdrawal of the
          Commodity from inventory each hour. Note that this is the same as
          setting Min Withdrawal when Horizon Periods
            per Day is 24, and only applies for sub-hourly resolution
          modeling. By default this is a 'hard' constraint. To create a soft
          constraint, create a Constraint with a Penalty Price .
