Paragraphs:
Gas Storage Withdrawal Volume Factor is a percentage of Max Volume for which withdrawal is allowed in a given band. Further withdrawals from the storage causing the volume to drop below the volume for this band takes the simulation into the next band. The value Withdrawal Volume Factor corresponds with the Withdrawal Rate Scalar value for each band. This input is an alternative for Withdrawal Volume .

When Use Additive Ratchet is Yes, the input is incremental, starting from the last band to the first. Consider the following gas storage withdrawal ratchet:

This defines a 1000 TJ Gas Storage with three withdrawal bands. Band 1 has a volume of .4 * 1000 TJ and can be withdrawn from at a rate of (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2) * 100 TJ per time period. Band 2 has a volume of .3 * 1000 TJ and can be withdrawn from at a rate of (0.3 + 0.2) * 100 TJ per time period after band 1 has been depleted. Lastly, band 3 has a volume of .3 * 1000 TJ and can be withdrawn from at a rate of 0.2 * 100 TJ per time period, after bands 1 and 2 have been depleted.
