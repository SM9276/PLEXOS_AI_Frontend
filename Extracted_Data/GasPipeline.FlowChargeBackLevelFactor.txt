Description:	Level factor corresponding to Flow Charge Back

Paragraphs:
Gas Pipeline Flow Charge Back Level Factor is a percentage of Max Flow Back Day for which flow is allowed in a given band each day. Further flow from the pipeline causing the flow to go above the flow for this band takes the simulation into the next band. The value Flow Charge Back Level Factor corresponds with the Flow Charge Back value for each band. This input is an alternative for Flow Charge Back Level .
