Paragraphs:
Heat Plant Heat Input Nodes is the collection of Heat Nodes that the heat plant connects and receives heat from. This can be used to model a waste heat recovery unit, in which the heat plant recovers waste heat from other gas turbine generators via a common heat node. A heat plant can connect to many heat nodes. The total amount of received heat will be the sum of the heat supplied from all the heat input nodes.
