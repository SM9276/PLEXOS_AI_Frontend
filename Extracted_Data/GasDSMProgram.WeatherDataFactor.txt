Description:	Weather data factor for gas demand function

Paragraphs:
Gas DSM Program Weather Data Factor is a multi-band scalar value. For each Gas Demand attached to the DSM program, Wind Speed data that falls within a Weather Data Variable band will be multiplied by the corresponding Weather Data Factor for that band.
                This value is aggregated to calculate max demand reduction for expansion and regular DSM programs.
