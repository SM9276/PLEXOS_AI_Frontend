Description:	Incremental cost of extracting gas at the pipeline sending node

Paragraphs:
Gas Pipeline Flow Charge Back is the incremental cost of
            extracting gas at the pipeline sending node. Flow Charge Back is a multi-band property and
            can be used to specify different charges for different flow levels when used in conjunction with
            Flow Charge Back Level. This is charged against the Flow backward in each interval. The total cost of this charge is reported as Production Cost . When multiple bands are used, 
            these should be specified in increasing order by cost.

This charge can only be applied to bi-directional gas pipelines.
