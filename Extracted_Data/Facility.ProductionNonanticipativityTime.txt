Description:	Window of time over which to enforce production non-anticipativity constraints

Paragraphs:
Facility Production
          Non-anticipativity  sets the time frame over which Production is non-anticipative in a stochastic optimization. This property is
          used in conjunction with Production
            Non-anticipativity .
