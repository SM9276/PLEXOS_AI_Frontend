Paragraphs:
Zone Constraints Firm Capacity Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of the
          total Zone Generators Firm Capacity in the
          constraint including the impact of Maintenance events.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation.
