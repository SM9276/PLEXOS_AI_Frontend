Header: LT Plan Compute Multi-area Reliability Indices

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	Master switch for computation of reliability indices LOLP, LOLE, etc across multiple areas.

Paragraphs:
LT Plan Compute Reliability Indices toggles on/off the algorithm that computes the following reliability indices:

These indices are computed using the state space decomposition and Monte Carlo approaches described in the Multi-area LOLP topic.
