Header: LT Plan Storage Restart

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	If recycled storage should restart from their initial volume at the start of each capacity optimization period

Paragraphs:
By default Storage End
            Volume is calculated across the entirety of each simulation
          step. This means that LT Plan simulations with long steps can lead to optimization problems that are
          difficult and slow to solve. This option breaks the storage tracking
          at the start of each capacity optimization period (default being year)
          and restarts the storage from its Initial
            Volume . The option applies only to storage with End
            Effects Method = "Recycle", since this is the only sensible
          option, as it ensures that the storage trajectories match at the end
          of one year and start of the next.
