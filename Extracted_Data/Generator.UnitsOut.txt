Paragraphs:
Generator Units Out defines
              'discrete' (or planned) maintenance events. The property can be
              used with the Date From and Date To fields to set the exact period
              of outage. Units Out can also be defined with a Variable or Data File object. Units Out
              is a multi-band property. Each band defines an outage of the
              severity defined in that band.

For the example in Table 1 there are two types of outage
              (identified by bands one and two respectively). The band one
              outages are total outages ( Outage
                Rating = 0).

Generators are modeled as single unit ( Units = 1) or multiple unit facilities ( Units > 1). When modelling forced (random) outages and maintenance
              outages, units at multi-unit stations are tracked individually in
              the simulation so it possible to have both types of outages in the
              same period on different units.

The total Discrete
                Maintenance (as defined by Units Out) is summed up and
              subtracted from the Distributed
                Maintenance requirement (defined by Maintenance
                Rate ).
