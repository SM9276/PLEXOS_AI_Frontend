Header: Battery Charge Efficiency

Table Details:
Units:	%
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	70
Validation Rule:	Between 0 And 100
Key Property:	No
Description:	Efficiency of charging
BESS	Units	1	-
BESS	Max Load	10	MW
BESS	Charge Efficiency	90	%

Paragraphs:
Battery Charge Efficiency is the
          ratio of power stored in the battery to the load on the grid i.e. including any losses such as inverter losses.

Example:

If the BESS operates at Max Load of 1 MW for one hour then 1 MWh is the Load on the grid and 1 Ã— 0.9 = 0.9 MWh of Charging is stored in the battery increasing the SoC .
          The losses are 0.1 MWh .
