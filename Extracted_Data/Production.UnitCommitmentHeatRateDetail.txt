Header: Production Unit Commitment Heat Rate Detail

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	True (-1)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	If modeling fully detailed heat rates for unit commitment. Otherwise perform a two-pass UC/ED.

Paragraphs:
Production Unit Commitment Heat
          Rate Detail toggles on/off co-optimization of detailed heat
            rate functions and unit commitment.Â  When 'on' (default)
          the detailed multi-point heat rate functions and any integers
          associated with non-convex
            heat rate functions are optimized simultaneously with unit
          commitment. When 'off' the heat rates are simplified to the average
          value at maximum output during an initial optimization pass to
          determine the unit commitment. That unit commitment solution (integer
          on/off and start/stop decisions) is then frozen and then fully
          detailed heat rate functions reinstated for a second-pass to compute
          the optimal dispatch.

Turning off this option generally results in faster solution times
          for UC/ED problems without significantly compromising solution
          quality. Note however turning off this option will trigger two passes
          for the UC/ED rather than one, which in some cases might be slower.
          You should confirm that the solution is of acceptable quality by
          comparing model runs with and without the option unchecked.
