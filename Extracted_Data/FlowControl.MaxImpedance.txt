Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Max Impedance

Paragraphs:
Flow Control Max Impedance is user specified Impedance limits for DSR, TCSC and MSSR type of devices. The Impedance limitation can be derived as a function of line flow:

Therefore, the Max Impedance input is applied as flow/angle limits and replacing the user input Min Angle . Note that Max Impedance must be larger than or equal to Min Impedance.
