Paragraphs:
The following definitions are used throughout this article:

Note that the fuel units shown in the examples here are sometimes GJ
          (giga-joules - Metric) and sometimes MMBTU (million British Thermal
          Units - Imperial U.S.), but all examples apply to either unit system.
          Note that "giga" means billion units, and the "M" in "MMBTU" refers to
          the Roman numeral "M" meaning one thousand, thus "MM" is a way of
          saying thousand thousands or a million since there is no Roman numeral
          for million other than the rather awkward convention of writing M with
          an over-bar.

In the simulator:

Where the heat input function is defined as a polynomial function y =
          a + bx + cx 2 + dx 3 , the a term (intercept of the heat input function
          with the y-axis) is Heat Rate Base, b (linear term) is Heat Rate Incr,
          c (quadratic term) is Heat Rate Incr2, and the optional d (tertiary
          term) is Heat Rate Incr3. Broadly speaking the term "heat rate function" might refer to the
          marginal or average heat rate function. Both are derived from the heat
          input function. There is wide variation on the way heat data are
          provided for use in simulation models. For convenience then the
          simulator provides six different methods of input by specifying one of
          the schemes in Table 1. Table 1: List of available heat input function schemes.

Note that hydro generator efficiency is defined similarly with
          properties Efficiency Base and Efficiency Incr however the efficiency
          is the inverse of the marginal heat rate used for thermal generators.

The schemes in Table 1 are simply a method for defining the heat
          input function. Having received these input the simulator:

The Production settings Fuel Use Function Precision and Max Heat Rate
            Tranches control the accuracy and number of tranches used in this
            step-wise function. The setting Generator Max Heat Rate Tranches
            provides the same control by Generator object. As mentioned above, one
            tranche is used for generation below Min Stable Level. Notes for input scheme 4 : If the Max Heat Rate Tranches is less than
                    the number of Heat Rate Incr bands, the points are used verbatim. If the Max Heat Rate Tranches is greater than or equal to the number of Heat Rate Incr bands, a polynomial
                    will be fit to the points and new Load Point / Heat Rate Incr pairs will be generated to create as many bands
                    as defined by the Max Heat Rate Tranches input. Notes for input scheme 6 : If the Max Heat Rate Tranches is equal
                    to the number of Heat Rate bands, the points are used verbatim. If the Max Heat Rate Tranches is greater than the number of Heat Rate bands, a polynomial
                    will be fit to the points and new Load Point / Heat Rate pairs will be generated to create as many bands
                    as defined by the Max Heat Rate Tranches input.

The step-wise approximation to the marginal heat rate function is
          based on the Fan
            Approximation method-see DRAYTON 1997 [1, 2]. This method uses
          separable programming to cast the polynomial heat input function as a
          linear approximation. Separable programming relies on certain
          characteristics both of the marginal heat rate tranches and the
          optimization's objective function and other constraints. Firstly the
          marginal heat rate 'steps' must be monotonically non-decreasing in
          cost. When this is not the case we refer to the function as being
          'non-convex'. Secondly their cost should not be zero, nor should any
          other constraint or cost in the optimization problem imply that the
          marginal value of steps is monotonically non-decreasing. In simple
          terms, the optimization must prefer the tranche one marginal heat rate
          first, tranche two second, and so on. Any other order and the
          approximation will yield an inaccurate modelled heat input function. To solve this issue the simulator allows you to switch to a variation
          of the Fan Approximation that includes additional constraints that
          ensure that the tranches are used in order. Because this version
          requires integer variables and additional constraints it is not
          enabled by default, however warnings from the simulator will indicate
          when this integer Fan Approximation might be needed:

You can switch to the integer Fan Approximation globally by setting
          Production Heat Rate Error Method to "Allow Non-convex". The setting
          Generator Formulate Non-convex provides the same function for
          individual objects. With this option enabled there is no restriction on the 'convexity' of
          the marginal heat rate function, which allows you to model marginal
          heat rate functions of practically any shape. Examples occur often
          when modelling CCGT plant as
          aggregate generator objects. By default Heat Rate Error Method is set to only warn about the
          non-convexity and "adjust" the marginal heat rate function to make it
          convex. The adjustment procedure is as follows. Assume the step-wise
          marginal heat rate function has steps (tranches) numbered from one
          being the tranche starting at notional zero generation to N being the
          tranche that runs up to Max Capacity:

Figure 1 shows an example of a simple linear heat input function in
          which the average and marginal heat rate curves are equal i.e. the
          heat input function has the form y = bx This type of function can be
          entered by setting the Heat Rate property of the generator as in the
          following example:

Note that Heat Rate Incr could also be used here.

Figure 2 shows an example of a linear heat input function in the form
          y = a + bx i.e. with constant marginal heat rate but variable average
          heat rate. This type of function can be entered by setting the Heat
            Rate Base and Heat Rate
            Incr properties of the generator as in the following example:

Figure 3 shows an example of quadratic heat input function. The
          coefficients are entered using the properties, Heat Rate Base, heat
          Rate Incr, and Heat Rate Incr2 and in this example:

To simulate this curve, PLEXOS will automatically develop a piecewise
          linear approximation to the quadratic function, and you can specify
          how many linear tranches are used to make the approximation. This is
          described below.

An extension to this case is to add a third-order coefficient as in
          the following data and illustrated in Figure 4:

To simulate this curve, PLEXOS will develop a piecewise linear
          approximation, but here the marginal heat rate is not monotonically
          non-decreasing thus the function is not separable. PLEXOS solves this
          problem using MIP as described earlier.

PLEXOS allows for the specification of heat rate functions using
          pairs of heat rate (either marginal or average) along with megawatt
          load points. The following sections illustrate three methods of input
          based on the quadratic heat input function in Figure 3 i.e. these all
          produce the same outcome but use different combinations of input
          variables. These methods allow the input of heat rate functions that
          do not take simple functional forms like those in the preceding cases. Note that the Load Point may take any value and can overlap or skip
          parts of the 'normal' operating range of the unit if required.
          Further, as with the polynomial functions, PLEXOS does not require
          that the marginal heat rates are monotonically non-decreasing, thus
          any set of values can be entered. The user can also specify separate heat rate functions for different timeslices.          
          In such a case, it should be ensured that the number of bands remains the 
          same across all timeslices and the heat rate and load point information
          for all bands must be input. The following properties are common to all the examples:

The Heat Rate Base is
          specified along with multiple pairs of Load Point and Heat Rate Incr.
          Heat Rate Base is the intercept of the heat input function with the
          y-axis. Heat Rate Incr is the marginal heat rate at the mid-point of
          the band not at the Load Point itself. In this method, the data are
          describing the steps of a marginal cost function that PLEXOS should
          use to model the generator's heat input function and PLEXOS will use
          the function verbatim. An example for the function show in Figure 3 is:

The Heat Rate is specified at the Min Stable Level along with
          multiple pairs of Load Point and Heat Rate Incr. Heat Rate is the
          average heat rate at Min Stable Level and is provided only on the band
          1 Load Point. The first Load Point must always be at Min Stable Level
          and the last must be at Max Capacity. The Heat Rate Incr is the
          marginal heat rate at the mid-point of the band. An example for the function show in Figure 3 is:

Multiple Load Point and Heat Rate pairs are specified. Heat Rate is
          the average heat rate at each Load Point. The Load Point values may
          take any value and can overlap or skip parts of the 'normal' operating
          range of the unit if required. Thus, in this method, the data are
          describing points on the heat input function and PLEXOS will generate
          a piecewise linear model of the marginal heat rate function from these
          data.

Note : When using Heat Rate and Load points - the
          inputs will be approximated with a polynomial first and then tranches
          are created



To manually convert heat rate functions between formats, start by
          computing the heat input (in GJ or MMBTU) at each load point. The
          average heat rate function is simply the heat input at the load point
          divided by the generation at the point. The incremental function
          starts by computing the heat input at min stable level (either as an
          average heat rate using the Heat Rate property, or as the No Load
          input as Heat Rate Base), and then computing the incremental heat
          input for the incremental generation. The incremental heat rate is
          then the change in heat input from point n to point n-1 divided by the
          change in generation from point n to point n-1. Always remember unit conversion in the Imperial system. Because heat
          rates are expressed in BTU/kWh. Heat input in MMBTU is computed as the
          product of generation (MWh) times heat rate (BTU/kWh) times 0.001. The
          metric system units do not require conversion. Our Heat Rate examples above show the units of GJ/MWh = 1000 BTU/kWh.
          This is a convenience for the examples only, the actual conversion
          factor is 1055.06
