Header: Generator Build Non-anticipativity

Table Details:
Units:	$/MW
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	-1
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Price for violating non-anticipativity constraints in scenario-wise decomposition mode
Build Non-anticipativity	-1	$/MW		This value acts like infinity, so no recourse is
                available
Build Non-anticipativity	1000	$/MW	1/01/2015	
Build Non-anticipativity	100	$/MW	1/01/2020	
Build Non-anticipativity	0	$/MW	1/01/2025	Full recourse is now available on these decisions

Generator Build
          Non-anticipativity applies when the Stochastic
            Method is set to "scenario-wise decomposition". It is used to
          identify the first stage build decisions for LT Plan . The property can take any value, but there are two
          special cases to consider:

Any positive value then acts as a penalty on anticipating the values
          of the uncertain inputs. It is a useful feature that the
          non-anticipativity can be relaxed over time as in the following
          example:
