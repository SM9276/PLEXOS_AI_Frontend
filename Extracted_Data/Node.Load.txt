Paragraphs:
Node Load defines the local load at the specified node. There are a number
              of ways in which the Node load input
              can be defined, and it is generally built up out of several input
              components. The input options are considered in the following
              order:

1. Node Load

If you define Load directly as a input, then:

If the Region defines Fixed
                Load and/or Fixed
                Generation then this is assigned to the Node in proportion to the Load input.

2. Region Load

If you define Load on the Region ,
              the definition of load on the Node depends on whether or not the Zone membership is defined.

Without Zone membership:

Load = ( Region Load × Region Load
                Scalar + Fixed Load - Fixed Generation ) × Load
                Participation Factor + Fixed
                Load

With Zone membership:

Load = ( Region Load × Region Load
                Scalar + Fixed Load - Fixed Generation ) × Zone Load Participation
                Factor × Load
                Participation Factor + Fixed
                Load

3. Zone Load

If you associate the Node with a Zone and that Zone defines Load as input then:

Load = Zone Load × Zone Load
                Scalar × Zone Load
                Participation Factor × Load
                Participation Factor + Fixed
                Load

Note, in all cases, if the Node is
              not 'in-service' according to the Units property, then the load is zero.

Node Load as an output is defined
              as:

Note: If Single-pass GPF is selected as the Transmission Loss Method , losses are included in the Load.
