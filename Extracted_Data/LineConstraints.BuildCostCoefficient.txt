Paragraphs:
Line Constraints Build Cost is the left-hand side coefficient of Line Build Cost from the start of the
          horizon up to the current period in the constraint. The cost is the
          nominal lump-sum Build Cost i.e without any adjustment for Discount
            Rate .

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation.
