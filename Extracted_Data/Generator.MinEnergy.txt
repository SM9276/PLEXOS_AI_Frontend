Description:	Minimum energy

Paragraphs:
Generator Min Energy (and its
          period-specific variants) defines a lower bound on the sum of Generation across any interval, hour, day, week, month, or year.

The simulator converts the energy constraints into Constraint objects. By default the constraints are soft - see the Min
            Energy Penalty property for details.  The amount of
          violation and the cost are reported as Min
            Energy Violation and Min
            Energy Violation Cost .
