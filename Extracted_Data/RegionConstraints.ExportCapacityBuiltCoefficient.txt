Description:	Coefficient of export capacity built

Paragraphs:
Region Constraints Export Capacity Built Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of
          the total Region Export
            Capacity built from the start of the horizon up to the current
          period in the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation.
