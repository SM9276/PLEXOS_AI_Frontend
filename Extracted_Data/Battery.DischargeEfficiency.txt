Description:	Efficiency of discharging
BESS	Units	1	-
BESS	Max Power	10	MW
BESS	Discharge Efficiency	90	%

Paragraphs:
Battery Discharge Efficiency is the
          ratio of power sent to the grid over total power discharged from the
          battery i.e. including any inverter losses.

Example:

If the BESS operates at Max Power of 1 MW for one hour then 1 MWh is
          delivered to the grid as Generation and 1 / 0.9 = 1.11 MWh Discharging is taken from storage reducing the SoC .
          The losses are 0.11 MWh .
