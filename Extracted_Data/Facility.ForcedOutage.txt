Paragraphs:
Facility Forced Outage is the
              production capacity lost to random outages. It can be used as an
              input to define a known pattern of outages and can be defined with
              a Variable object or passed as
              an input from an Interleaved simulation to coordinate outage between models.

The definition of Forced Outage as an output varies by
              simulation phase:



Forced Outage = ∑ ( b )
                  ( Forced Outage Rate b × ( Max Operating
                    Level - Outage
                    Rating b )

where: b indexes the bands
                    of Forced Outage
                      Rate

Forced Outage reports the capacity on outage from the
                  realized outage events. Thus for any given event:

Forced Outage =∑ ( b ) ( Max Operating Level - Outage
                    Rating b )
                  × Units Out b

Note that if MT Schedule Chronology =
                  "Partial" then multiple discrete events may combine together
                  in any given period as a function of the slicing of the
                  duration curves and thus this profile may then resemble a
                  sculpted derating rather than discrete events.
