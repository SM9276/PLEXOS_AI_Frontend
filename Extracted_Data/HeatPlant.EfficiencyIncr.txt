Paragraphs:
Heat Plant Efficiency Incr is the efficiency of a heat plant in converting the input resources (fuels, electricity) into output heat. Efficiency Incr is used to describe the losses in the heat plant. Heat Production + HeatPlantON *(Efficiency Base) = (Fuel Off-take + 3.6*(Gen Load))*(Efficiency Incr) . The 'no-load efficiency' is defined using Efficiency Base .
