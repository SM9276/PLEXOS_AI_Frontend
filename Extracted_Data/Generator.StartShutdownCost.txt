Description:	Cost of unit starts and shutdowns

Paragraphs:
Generator Start & Shutdown
          Cost is the cost incurred for starting and shutting down units

For chronological simulation phases (see LT Plan Chronology, MT
          Schedule Chronology and ST
            Schedule ) this is:

Start & Shutdown Cost = Start
            Cost × Units Started + Shutdown Cost × Units
            Shutdown

When using multiple cooling states (hot, warm, cold for example), the
          reported start cost is based on the active cooling state. The active
          state can be inferred from the Hours
            Down output property.

The Start Cost referred to here includes:

The cost of emissions due to fuel
          used at start-up is not included here. Those costs are rolled in to
          the reported Emissions Cost .

For LT Plan and MT
            Schedule with Chronology = "Partial" the property is defined as:

Start & Shutdown Cost = Start Cost
          Mark-up × Generation

where the "Start Cost Mark-up" is defined by the setting LT
            Plan Start
            Cost Amortization Period , or MT
            Schedule Start
            Cost Amortization Period .
