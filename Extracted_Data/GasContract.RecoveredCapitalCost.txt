Paragraphs:
Gas Contract Recovered Capital Cost is the build cost that is recovered over a period of time, i.e. the investment recovery over the horizon using future cash flows. It is calculated as follows:

Recovered Capital Cost \[ \displaystyle = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{i} \times RP \times D_{i} \]

where \[ n \] is the total number of years, \[ i \] is the year, \[ P \] is the production(GJ), \[ RP \] is the Recovery Price ($/GJ), and \[ D \] is the discount factor.
