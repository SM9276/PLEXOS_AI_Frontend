Paragraphs:
LT Plan Start Cost Amortization
          Period provides a method for modelling the effect of Generator Start Cost in LT
            Plan when using the load duration curve method, which does not
          model unit commitment (start up and shutdown) explicitly.

The amortization period acts as a default when Min
            Up Time is not defined. The Start
            Cost is used to create a mark-up to the incremental cost of
          generation using the following formula:

This has the effect of penalizing units with high start cost.

The reported Start &
            Shutdown Cost includes this mark-up.
