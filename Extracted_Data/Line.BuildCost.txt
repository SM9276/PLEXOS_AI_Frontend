Paragraphs:
Line Build Cost as input is total 'overnight cost' of building the Line for the LT Plan algorithm. The Build Cost must be defined in combination with Economic Life and WACC as in this example:

Note how the property Max Units Built is used to indicate that the Line is allowed to be built.

Build Cost is a multi-band property. This allows user to model a stream of payments leading up to the time of build.

Example

Above example gives a series of payments in three years leading up to the commission date. It also implies that Line 'X-Y' needs three years to be built.

This cost is either treated as a lump sum, if the Economic Life is entirely inside the planning horizon, or it is annualized as described in the LT Plan topic.
