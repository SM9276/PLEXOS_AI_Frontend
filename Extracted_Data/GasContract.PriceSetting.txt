Description:	Flag if the gas contract can set price at the Gas Node

Paragraphs:
Gas Contract Price Setting defines if the gas contract can set the price at a Gas Node.

When enabled, this option invokes a price propagation algorithm in PLEXOS that, after solving the dispatch and pricing of a simulation step, will propagate the Gas Contract Price to any Gas Node that it supplies.

NOTE: This option requires that any bi-directional Gas Pipelines being modeled must use the Flow Charge Back property.
