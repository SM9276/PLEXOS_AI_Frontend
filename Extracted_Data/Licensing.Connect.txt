Header: Licensing: Connect

Table Details:

Paragraphs:
Many changes were made to version 3.x in order to bring the license server into PLEXOS Connect.

The motivation behind integrating it with PLEXOS Connect was to retain the existing functionality of version 3 while adding new features and better management through the use of PLEXOS Connect.

The PLEXOS Connect License Server will continue to operate as a Windows service by running in the PLEXOS Connect Server Windows service. This allows the License Server to continue operating without requiring a user to be logged in.

Since the License Server is now integrated into PLEXOS Connect and several new features added, there are quite a few differences between version 3.x and PLEXOS Connect License Server.
