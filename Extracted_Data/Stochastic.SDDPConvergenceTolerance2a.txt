Description:	Objective function convergence criteria 2 (with adjustment) used in SDDP if simplification applies

Paragraphs:
SDDP Convergence Tolerance 2a is an adjustment for the second
          convergence criteria, additional to SDDP
            Convergence Tolerance 2 it also requires the relative gap is
          below this tolerance when Simplified
            Chronology applies in the SDDP algorithm.
