Description:	Storage volume scaling factor used internal to the mathematical program.

Paragraphs:
Storage Internal Volume Scalar is the scaling factor used internally
          to the mathematical program for storage volumes. The default value of
          1000 is generally the best, unless the Max
            Volume is very large or very small. If you do receive warnings
          about poor scaling of the mathematical programming problem you can try
          set the value higher (for very large storage) or smaller (for small
          storage).

It is recommended to use the same scaling
          parameter among interconnected storages in a cascade. The warning Message 3225 will be generated if two 
          storages have different scalars and both connect to a Generator via Head Storage and Tail Storage memberships. This 
          arrangement can lead to a non-conservation of water through the cascade.
