Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0

Description:	Number of years overlap between steps where -1 invokes Rolling Horizon
20	20 (Auto)	0	1
20	11	2	2
20	8	2	3

Paragraphs:
By default LT Plan solves the entire Horizon in a single optimization step,
          but there are two alternatives:

Multi-step simulation is invoked with the option Step Size > 0. Overlap can then be any non-negative number.

The advantage of solving in steps is that the resolution of each step
          can be greater i.e. the number of time periods solved. The
          disadvantage is that the overall optimality of the solution is
          compromised due to the lack of 'look-ahead'. To improve on this, the LT Plan Overlap sets the number of years
          each step of LT Plan overlaps with the next, the default being no
          overlap. The duration of each step is controlled by the Step Size setting.

The following formula shows the number of steps calculation for a
          given horizon, step size and overlap, with the overlap and step size
          combination being valid if it returns an integer:

Number of Steps = (Horizon -
            Overlap) / (Step Size - Overlap)

Example

You are modelling a 20-year horizon starting in 2011. The table and
          Figure 1 shows the three possible combinations of At
            a Time and Overlap.





Rolling Horizon mode is invoked with Overlap = -1 and Step Size is > 1.

Rolling Horizon solves in multiple 'stages' progressively resolving
          the entire horizon to full detail. See the Step Size topic for more details.
