Description:	LT Plan simulation phase

Paragraphs:
See also LT Plan Property Reference for a detailed list of properties for this class of object.

The settings that control the capacity expansion planning function in
          the simulator are defined on LT Plan objects. Below is a comprehensive
          guide to LT Plan.





The term "capacity expansion" refers to the problem of finding the
          optimal combination of generation new builds and retirements and
          transmission upgrades (and retirements) that minimizes the net present
          value (NPV) of the total costs of the system over a long-term planning
          horizon. That is, to simultaneously solve a generation and
          transmission capacity expansion problem and a dispatch problem from a
          central planning, long-term perspective.

Capacity expansion is implemented via the LT Plan class of objects.
          The purpose of the LT Plan is then to solve the capacity expansion
          problem over the planning horizon-typically expected to be in the
          range of 10 to 30 years, though any horizon is possible. LT Plan
          appropriately deals with discounting and end-year effects.

LT Plan runs before the PASA / MT
            Schedule / ST Schedule phases.
          It is fully integrated with these other simulation phases. Thus, LT
          Plan can be run either separately or in sequence with these other
          simulation phases in a single simulation. In the latter role, the
          long-term build/retirement decisions made by LT Plan will be
          automatically passed down to the other phases, providing a seamless
          solution. In either role, the output of LT Plan can be accessed using
          the solution viewing functions. In addition the LT Plan build/retire
          decisions can be written to text file for use in subsequent
          simulations-see the setting Write
            Expansion Plan Text Files .

LT Plan can output the optimal expansion solution and optionally a hierarchy of sub-optimal
          solutions starting working down in solution
            quality .

LT Plan uses the same generic Constraint facility as other simulation phases. This means that complex unit
          staging, and other constraints can be modelled. Further, LT Plan
          provides the same capabilities as MT
            Schedule in modelling Emissions , Fuel constraints and Reserve .
          Like MT Schedule LT Plan can run
          in chronological mode or use Load Duration Curves (LDC) according to
          the LT Plan Chronology setting.
          In chronological mode LT Plan will capture the dynamic effects of
          intermittent generation and load uncertainty on generator cycling.
          Finally, LT Plan can be run in deterministic or stochastic modes. In
          stochastic mode it can be used to find the single optimal set of build
          decisions in the face of uncertainties in any input e.g. load, fuel prices, hydro inflows or wind generation.

The following types of expansion/retirement and features are
