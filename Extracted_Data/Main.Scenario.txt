Description:	Data scenario

Paragraphs:
See also Scenario Property Reference for a detailed list of properties for this class of
          object.

Scenario objects allow data to be labelled with a particular scenario name. Scenarios are created in the same ways as
        other objects. Once created, any property can be tagged with that scenario name. Model objects (the objects that are executed during a simulation) have a Scenarios collection. Adding a Scenario to this collection instructs PLEXOS to use all
        the properties tagged with that scenario name as well as all properties that have no tag. Data from Scenarios overrides
        untagged data.

Where two Scenarios specify values for the same datum in the same time period, the Scenarios are read in alphabetical
        order. Although this behaviour can be overridden using the Read Order property.

Selecting a Scenario object in the PLEXOS interface and the Properties window displays all the properties in the
        database that are tagged with that Scenarios name. Deleting a Scenario object causes all data associated with that Scenario
        to be deleted too.
