Description:	Maximum quantity of gas that can be extracted from the pipeline sending node

Paragraphs:
Gas Pipeline Max Flow Back is the maximum quantity of gas that can be extracted from the pipeline sending node in any interval of the simulation. Only when Max Flow Back is defined, gas pipeline is modeled as bi-directional.

For multi-period limits see the following properties:
