Description:	SOLVER engine used by PLEXOS.

Paragraphs:
The option Performance SOLVER
          sets the mathematical programming solver that is used by the simulation
          engine. The option can take one of the following values:

To use any of the solvers you must license the corresponding "Support
          for ..." component. The PLEXOS installation includes the libraries for
          all solvers so no additional installation or configuration is required
          beyond obtaining a license to run the selected solver.





The solvers implement a number of algorithms for optimizing
          mathematical programming problems. These algorithms are referred to in
          a number of Performance options. The following explains the available
          options:





Multi-threading (or parallelization) can greatly improve optimizer
          performance. However, not all algorithms and solvers support
          multi-threading. Please refer to Optimizing
            Performance for more details.
