Header: Report Class

Table Details:
Description:	Set of report selections

Paragraphs:
See also Report Property Reference for a detailed list of properties for this class of
          object.

Report objects hold the selections of output properties to be reported on. Report objects are also used to filter the
        objects reported on. This is done via the list collection of a report and instructs the simulator to report only those
        objects. If there are no objects of a particular type (e.g. no fuels) in the list, then by default all Fuel objects are
        reported (see List Inclusive Empty for more information). You can control whether the report filtering
        applies to interval data or summary data with the options Filter Objects by Interval and Filter Objects in Summary .

The exception is the Timeslices collection. By default the simulator will not report data by user-defined Timeslice , but if you add one or more Timeslice objects to the associated List object the simulator will report all summary data across those selected timeslices.

There are three formats available for the solution data controlled by the settings:
Lists:
	- Write XML Files
	- Write Flat Files
	- Write Database
