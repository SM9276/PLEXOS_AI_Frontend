Paragraphs:
Charging Station Charge
          Price is the price paid per unit of energy drawn from the grid for
          charging Vehicles attached to the charging station expressed in c/kWh. It is calculated
          as:

Charge Price = 0.1 ( Node Price + UoS
            Charge )

Note the factor 0.1 converts the nodal price and UoS
            Charge in $/MWh to c/kWh for reporting.
