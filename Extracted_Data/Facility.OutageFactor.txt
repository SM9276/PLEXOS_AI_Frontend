Paragraphs:
Facility Outage sets the Outage
            Operating Level of each unit during the associated Outage or Maintenance outage as a
          proportion of the Max
            Operating Level . The default value is zero means that the outage
          is total. To specify a partial outage use a value greater than zero
          and less than 100. See the Units Out topic for examples.

In this example the outage factor is 90%, and so the implied Outage
Operating
            Level is 10 i.e. (1 - Outage Factor) x Max
            Operating Level .

Note that Outage Factor overrides Outage
Operating
            Level if both are defined.
