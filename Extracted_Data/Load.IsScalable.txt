Paragraphs:
There are two methods to specify the loads at a node using Load .

The IsScalable property lets the user select the method that should be
          applied for specifying each load. If the IsScalable property of a load
          is set to Yes, then the first method is used to calculate the load
          value. Else, the load specified in the Load property is used.

The following example demonstrates how the IsScalable property works.
          Let a company (Company_1) serve one customer (Load_1), and another
          company (Company_2) serve two customers (Load_2, Load_3) at node
          Node_1. Let the total load served by Company_1 and Company_2 be equal
          to 500 MW and 600 MW, respectively.
