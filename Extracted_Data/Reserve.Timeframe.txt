Paragraphs:
Reserve Timeframe is used to compute the maximum response of generators in the timeframe required for the reserve class, using the formula:

This limit is only computed if Timeframe is defined in combination with ramping limits. The actual maximum response of a generator is the minimum of this ramp-related limit at the limit set by Max Response .
