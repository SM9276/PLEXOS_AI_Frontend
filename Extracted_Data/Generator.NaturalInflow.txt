Description:	Natural inflow to the generator (controllable and uncontrolled)

Paragraphs:
Generator Natural Inflow is the
          natural inflow directly to the generator. This inflow occurs after any
          release from the (optional) Head
            Storage . The flow can be partly controllable as defined by the Controllable Inflow property. The uncontrolled inflows must be either generated with or
          spilled past the generator either to 'the sea' or the Tail
            Storage (if defined) in the period they arrive. The controllable
          inflows are similar but can be used any time inside a single partial chronology block e.g. week.

The Natural Inflow is also a reporting property along with:
