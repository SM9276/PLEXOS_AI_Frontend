Paragraphs:
Battery Levelized Capital
                Carrying Rate is the yearly cost for the battery project as a
                percentage of the Build Cost.

The levelized capital carrying rate is the rate that a company is
                expected to pay to finance its assets. Specifying Levelized Capital
                Carrying Rate overrides the properties that otherwise specify the
                yearly cost of a generation project i.e. WACC , Economic Life , Depreciation
                    Method , Tax Rate , and Inflation
                    Rate . The Discount Rate will be applied based upon the LCCR Apply Discounting input.
                The End Effects Method will be applied if applicable.

The yearly cost applied to the generation project will be equal to:

Levelized Capital Carrying Rate x Build
                    Cost
