Paragraphs:
As an input, Vehicle Charge Efficiency is the
          efficiency of the electric vehicle charging progress. It is the ratio
          of power stored in the battery to the load on the Charging
            Station i.e. it takes into account losses such as
          inverter losses.

As an output, Charge Efficiency reflects the input value less any Charge Efficiency Degradation .
