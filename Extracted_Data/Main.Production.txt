Description:	Production settings

Paragraphs:
See also Production
              Property Reference for a detailed list of properties for this
            class of object.

Production objects control various settings related to the modelling
          of the generation system such as how strictly integer unit commitment
          is enforced. To apply a Production object to your Model add it to the Model's Production collection.
          Note that associating the object with a Model defines the global settings, but you can optionally associate it with
          individual simulation phases e.g. LT
            Plan to run different settings in different phases of your
          simulation.
