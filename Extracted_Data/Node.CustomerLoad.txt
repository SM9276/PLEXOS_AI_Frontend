Paragraphs:
Node Customer Load is all the load
          served to customers at the node and is defined as:

Customer Load = Load - ( Unserved Energy + Demand
            Curtailed ) - ( Pump Load + Generator
            Auxiliary Use ) - Losses - Fixed
            Generation - Heat Plant Load (Usage) - Gas Plant Energy Consumption - Gas Storage Energy Consumption - Water Plant Energy Consumption

Customer Load is the load that is actually paid for by customers, not
          including generators, as opposed to Load which includes loads that are not part of 'consumption' but must be
          generated for all the same.

Note that, for the case where the Node defines Price as an input:

Customer Load = Dump
            Energy
