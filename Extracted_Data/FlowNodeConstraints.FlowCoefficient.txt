Description:	Coefficient of Flow Node flow

Paragraphs:
Flow Node Constraints is the left-hand side coefficient of the Flow in the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × Flow
            Node Flow ... {≤,
            ≥, =} b j
