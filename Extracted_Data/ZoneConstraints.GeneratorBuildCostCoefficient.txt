Description:	Coefficient of total cost of generator builds

Paragraphs:
Zone Constraints Generator Build Cost Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of
          the total Zone Generators Build Cost from the start of
          the horizon up to the current period in the constraint. The cost is
          the nominal lump-sum Build Cost i.e without any adjustment for Discount
            Rate .

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation.
