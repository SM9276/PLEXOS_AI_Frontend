Paragraphs:
Flow Path Bundle Size constrains
          the Flow on the path to be in
          multiples of the given size.



For the example in Table 1, the Flow can take values 0, 25, 50, 75, ... up to the maximum flow of 550.

Note that if the flow limits ( Max
            Flow and Min Flow ) are not a
          multiple of Bundle Size the flow will be capped at the highest
          multiple of Bundle Size less than the limit.
