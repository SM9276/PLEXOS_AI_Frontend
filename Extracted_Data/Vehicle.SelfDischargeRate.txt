Header: Vehicle Self Discharge Rate

Table Details:
Units:	%
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Percentage of stored energy lost per hour due to self-discharge.

Paragraphs:
Vehicle self discharge rate models the rate of energy loss within the vehicle due to internal discharge effects.
                Self discharge losses occur in the absence of any external connection: a vehicle does not need to be Discharging , or Charging or driving to experience self discharge losses.

Vehicle self discharge rate represents the percentage of storaged energy lost per hour. Self discharge losses are reported in Vehicle Self Discharge Losses .

Vehicle SoC must be formulated for self discharge to be modelled. 
                This property is therefore only valid with detailed Vehicle models (those defining energy storage properties such as Capacity and Efficiency ). Detailed and simple vehicle models are described in Vehicle .
