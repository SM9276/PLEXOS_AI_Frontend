Header: PASA Constraints Enabled

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	True (-1)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	If transmission line constraints are enabled in PASA.

Paragraphs:
PASA Constraints Enabled toggles on/off transmission Line constraints in the reserve sharing formulation. When this option is toggled 'on' the flow of capacity reserves across inter-regional lines is constrained by the thermal limits on the Lines .

See also:

When both options are 'off' the system is treated as a single unconstrained transmission area where reserve capacity can be shared for the objective of leveling reserves over time.
