Description:	Random number seed assigned to the generator for the generation of outages

Paragraphs:
Setting Generator Random Number
          Seed to a value other than zero allows you to control the sequence of
          random numbers used to create distributed maintenance and
          forced outage events. This seed overrides the Random
            Number Seed defined on the Model .

Note that you can capture the seeds generated from another simulation
          with the Diagnostic Random
            Number Seed .

This option can be useful if you want to ensure that a sequence of
          outages is repeated regardless of other changes in the data input,
          since by default the seeding can change when new Generator objects are added to the system.

To instead save a particular pattern of outages so that you can reuse
          them, use the Write Outage
            Text Files feature of PASA .
