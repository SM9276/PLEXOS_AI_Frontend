Paragraphs:
Requesting a License License requests are made automatically each time you start a PLEXOS application. Under normal circumstances this will all happen seamlessly, and will require no input from the user. If however there are problems and a license cannot be allocated, the user will be notified. Requesting a License From a Local License File When PLEXOS is started, the application will first search for a local license file (DA_lcl.lic). If one is found, the file will be queried for a license. If a license is available PLEXOS will start. If however a license is not available the application will search for other available licenses (USB or Server). For information on creating a local file see Getting started using a local license file . Requesting a License From a USB Dongle To use a USB license, simply plug the USB dongle into your USB port and start PLEXOS If a license is available PLEXOS will start. If however a license is not available the application will search for other available licenses (Local or Server). For information on setting up a USB dongle see Getting started using USB Licensing. Requesting a License from a License Server After failing to find a local or USB license file, the PLEXOS client will then use it's default settings to look for a license server. If the license server is found, and a license is allocated to PLEXOS, the application will continue, and you will be able to use PLEXOS. If however a license is not available the user will be alerted and the application will be shut down. For more information on the checkout process please take a look at the overview section . License Checkout Failures There are 2 main reasons for the application failing to obtain a license. No connection to license server This error occurs when your application cannot find the license server, you will receive a message box like the one to the right. This box gives you a few options. If you know the license server is on your local machine, check the 'This machine radio button', and click retry to try to connect to the local machine. If the license server is on another machine, check the "Different machine" radio button and enter the IP address of the license server. If you do not know this information, please see your system administrator. Click retry to attempt the connection to the license server. If you are still having problems connecting, click the help button. This will suggest some possible solutions, and also gives you further information on the error you are experiencing. Enabling "Allow automatic reconnection" will allow the application to continually retry for a server connection automatically every 30 seconds, should the license server become available. This is handy for overnight, unmonitored model runs. License declined. There are a number of possible reasons for your license request being declined. The license file has been corrupted or tampered with. For a resolution to this problem contact your software supplier. The Server license has expired There are no licenses available for the product you are using.
