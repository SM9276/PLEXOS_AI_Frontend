Description:	If the relationship between the reserves is cascading or not

Paragraphs:
Reserve Nested Reserves Cascading is a flag that determines whether the relationship between the reserves is cascading or not.
            When the relationship is Cascading, a higher quality nested reserve (e.g. regulation up) can be used to meet a lower quality reserve (e.g. spinning) requirement.
            When the relationship is not Cascading, the Reserve and its Nested Reserve must be of the same type.
