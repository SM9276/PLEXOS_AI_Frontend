Header: Storage Non-physical Spill Penalty

Table Details:
Units:	$/MW
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	-1
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Penalty applied to non-physical spill from the storage. A value of -1 means none are allowed.

Paragraphs:
Storage Non-physical Spill Penalty toggles on/off inclusion of variables that represent 'non-physical' Spill from the Storage . These spills are analogous to Dump Energy in the transmission system i.e. they represent additional releases required to obtain a feasible storage balance. The default value of -1 means that non-physical spill is not allowed.

The amount of non-physical spill is reported as Storage Non-physical Spill . When non-physical spills occur the reported End Volume might be above Max Volume . Thus this setting should only be used to assist with diagnosing infeasibilities in hydro models.
