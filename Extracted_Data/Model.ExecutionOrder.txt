Paragraphs:
Model Execution Order is the order in which to execute the Model when running in a batch.

PLEXOS orders the models in ascending Execution Order if defined.  A typical example of this can be seen in the following table:

In this example "Model 3" is executed first, as its default execution order number is zero.  Similarly this property can be used to define the execution order of the models within a project .  For example, if a Project is defined with the Model memberships, as shown in the table below, then "Model 3" would be executed first followed by "Model 1" and "Model 2".
