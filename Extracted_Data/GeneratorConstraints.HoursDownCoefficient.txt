Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Hours Down Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of the number
          of hours the facility's units have been off referenced to the
          beginning of the simulation interval i.e. the numbers of
          hours since the unit last shut
            down . For the first interval of the Horizon this is determined by Initial
            Hours Down .

This coefficient is useful for defining custom constraints similar to Generator Min
            Down Time or for modelling cooling states by combining this
          coefficient with Generator Constraints Units
            Started Coefficient .

For the example in Table 1 the Generator " S1C _GT1"
          cannot start until Generator " GT1 " has
          been off for four hours.

This coefficient can be applied to single- unit or multi-unit facilities. In the latter case, Hours Down Coefficient
          is the number of hours the whole multi-unit facility has been shut
          down.
