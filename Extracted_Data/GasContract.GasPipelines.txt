Description:	gas pipelines that have a contract to transport gas

Paragraphs:
Gas Contract Gas Pipelines is the collection of gas pipelines which are contracted to transport gas. The defined collection of gas pipelines must form a simple path, starting from the gas node which the Gas Contract Gas Field is connected to, for the collection to be considered valid.

To ensure the contract gas is transported through these pipelines, the total incremental flow charge associated with the pipelines is added as a negative coefficient to the contract production variable in the objective function.
