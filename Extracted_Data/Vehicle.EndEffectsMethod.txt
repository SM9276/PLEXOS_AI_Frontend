Table Details:
Units:	-
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	2
Validation Rule:	In (1,2)
Key Property:	No
Description:	Method used to value or constrain end-of-period energy.

Paragraphs:
Vehicle End Effects Method describes the valuation of end-of-step energy within the optimization. Two options are given:

Vehicle SoC must be formulated for any end effects treatment.
                This property is therefore only valid with detailed Vehicle models (those defining energy storage properties such as Capacity and Efficiency ). Detailed and simple vehicle models are described in Vehicle .
