Key Property:	No
Description:	Window of time over which to enforce non-anticipativity constraints in scenario-wise decomposition

Paragraphs:
Generator Generation
          Non-anticipativity Time sets the time frame over which Generation is non-anticipative in a stochastic optimization. This property is
          used in conjunction with Generation
            Non-anticipativity .
