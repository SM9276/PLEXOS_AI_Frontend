Paragraphs:
This option causes the PASA phase to write outages for Generator and Line objects to text files, in a format that can be read back into subsequent simulations. The files produced are named after the Model that produced them. For example if the Model is called "Base" the files are:

And similarly for lines.

The "Units Out" file lists the 'complete' outages of the generators i.e. where the unit is entirely out-of-service, whereas the "Rating" file lists the generator rating during any partial outage (which only applies when outages are defined using Outage Rating ).

Example "Units Out" and "Units Out (sans partial)" file

Example "Rating" file

Example "Outage Rating" file

These text files can be directly referenced by the Units Out and Rating / Outage Rating properties so that this pattern of outages is repeated.

Example:

Here we define three Scenarios . "Automatic Outages" defines the data necessary for PASA to generate automatic maintenance outages for the Generator . In this example, two bands of outages are defined so that one band controls complete unit outages, and the second partial outages (through the Outage Rating property). Assuming we then ran a Model called "Automatic Outages" with the Write Outage Text Files option enabled the resulting text files could be referenced by a second Model using the "Hardwired Outages" Scenario or the "Hardwired Outages sans partial" Scenario .  The "Hardwired" Scenario's define two different approaches to feeding the "Automatic Outages" into another model.  Using the "Rating" and "Units Out (sans partial)" files, or "Hardwired Outages sans partial" Scenario , is more compact but when fed back in the partial maintenance events are not picked up.
