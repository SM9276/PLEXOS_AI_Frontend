Description:	Transmission node/bus

Paragraphs:
See also Node
              Property Reference for a detailed list of properties for this
            class of object.

Nodes connect to the transmission system:

A Node must belong to a Region and
          may belong to one or more Zone objects.
          Electric load is defined directly with the Load property or through the Region or Zone (s) with the Load
            Participation Factor property.

A Node might be part of a simple 'transportation' network or a
          complex ac transmission network. For ac networks, a Node represents a
          'bus' in the transmission network, and Line and Transformer objects represent
          ac or dc lines and transformers respectively.
