Paragraphs:
Facility Start Window is a flag
          indicating whether a start is allowed in the given time period. This
          might represent workforce, environmental or other constraints that
          dictate when the plant can start.



For the example in Table 1, the plant can only start in hour 9 each
          day.

Note that restricting the start window can improve the solution time
          of hard unit commitment problems be eliminating alternative solutions.
