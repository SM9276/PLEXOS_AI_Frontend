Header: Vehicle SoC

Table Details:
Units:	%
Mode:	Output Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	
Validation Rule:	
Key Property:	No
Description:	State of charge

Paragraphs:
Vehicle SoC is a measurement of available battery energy and is defined as:

SoC = Energy / Capacity x Units

The value will be between Min SoC and Max SoC .

Note: For simulations using partial chronology e.g. LT
            Plan with Chronology =
          "Partial" the value of SoC might be out
          of the range [0%, 100%] in between energy storage balance periods. For
          chronological simulations however the SoC will always be inside range.
