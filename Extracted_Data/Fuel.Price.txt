Paragraphs:
This is the per Unit price of the fuel .





In the example in Table 1, the price of "OIL" is $50/bbl (which has an Energy Density of 6118 MJ/bbl),
          thus its implied price per unit of energy is 50/(6118/1000) =
          $8.17/GJ. "GAS" however is simply $9/GJ.





For interval data, if Price is defined as input then it sets the
          output Price. Otherwise if there are no Fuel
            Contracts associated with the Fuel the Price is set by the Shadow Price .
          Finally, if there is one or more Fuel
            Contracts on the Fuel then the
          Price is defined as:

In summary data Price is defined by this ratio. If Offtake is zero in any period then this volume-weighted Price is also zero.
          You can see the time-weighted version in the property Time-weighted
            Price .
