Description:	Transmission region/area

Paragraphs:
See also Region
              Property Reference for a detailed list of properties for this
            class of object.

Regions represent transmission 'areas'. A Region may contain one or
          more Nodes (transmission buses) and
          can define the Load input to be
          distributed to the nodes according to their Load
            Participation Factor .

Regions can define different market rules through settings such as Load Settlement Model and Uplift Compatibility .

Regions provide a wealth of reported outputs including the
          supply-demand balance with properties like Load , Generation and Net
            Interchange as well as details of financial settlements e.g. Generator Pool Revenue , Cost to Load , and Settlement
            Surplus .

Note that the Zone class provides an
          additional method for grouping nodes. There is no set hierarchy
          between Region and Zone so you may have Zones inside Regions or vice
          versa, or Zones that cross several Regions as desired.
