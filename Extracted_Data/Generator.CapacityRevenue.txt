Paragraphs:
Generator Capacity Revenue is the
          revenue from capacity payments, calculated when the LT
            Plan Capacity
            Payments Enabled setting is 'on'. Capacity Revenue is calculated
          as:

If Capacity Price is
          defined as an input,

Capacity Revenue = Capacity
            Price × (1000 × Firm
            Capacity ) / periods_in_year

Otherwise,

Capacity Revenue = ( Region Capacity Shadow Price + Zone Capacity
            Shadow Price ) × (1000 × Firm
            Capacity ) / periods_in_year

NOTE: The Zone component applies on
          when the Zone is defined as capacity
          type.

The Capacity Price is
          calculated by LT Plan and passed to
          subsequent simulation phases.
