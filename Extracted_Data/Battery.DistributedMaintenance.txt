Paragraphs:
Battery Distributed Maintenance is an output of the PASA simulation phase. It represents the 'idealized' maintenance profile for the Battery assuming that any amount of capacity from zero to Max Power can be scheduled at any time. This idealized profile forms part of the calculation of Region Maintenance Factor but is not directly used to define maintenance events for the individual Battery. The 'realized' maintenance events are reported during MT Schedule and ST Schedule with the Maintenance property.
