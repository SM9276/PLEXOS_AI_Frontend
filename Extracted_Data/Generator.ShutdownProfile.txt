Paragraphs:
Generator Shutdown Profile defines a series of megawatt steps that the generating units pass through while running down from Min Stable Level to zero. Note that if this running down rate is constant you should use the Run Down Rate property instead.

The input scheme for this property is a special case, where the Timeslice field is used to identify the stages of the shutdown.
