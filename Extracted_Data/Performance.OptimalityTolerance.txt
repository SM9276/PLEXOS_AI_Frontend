Description:	Optimality tolerance (0 = solver default value)

Paragraphs:
Performance Optimality Tolerance
          is a solver setting for the simplex optimizer. Increasing the
          optimality tolerance can reduce the solver run time but may lead to
          differences in the results. The default value of zero means 'use the
          solver default' which is generally 1e-6.

If barrier is used for the root node and simplex is used for branch and bound nodes, optimality tolerance will also apply during the crossover phase.
