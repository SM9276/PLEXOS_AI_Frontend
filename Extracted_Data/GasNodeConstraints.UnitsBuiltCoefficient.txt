Paragraphs:
Gas Node Constraints Units Built Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient in the
          constraint of the binary (0,1) variable indicating if the Gas
            Node is built to date.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:
