Paragraphs:
Generator Load Subtracter is
          capacity subtracted from the system load prior to either slicing of
          the curve into LDC and then blocks or chronological fitting (depending
          on the chronology setting of the simulation phase). This applies to MT Schedule and LT
            Plan . For systems with a significant amount of No
            Cost Generation Capacity such as solar, wind and other
          renewables subtracting the profile of this generation off the system
          load will yield a net load profile that is more accurate for the LDC
          method.

Note that for simulation the original load is always used. This
          property only affects the LDC slicing or chronological period
          fitting/sampling.

The defined amount is by default subtracted from the load regardless of
          the number of Units installed. However, Load Subtracter Global can be used to control how the value is interpreted for multi-unit generators.

Example

In the following example the Generator represents a renewable source "PV". The 1 MW units are scaled up to
          the installed capacity via the Escalator shown in Table 2. Likewise the Rating is produced by a Variable in Table
          3. The Load Subtracter then has the same Variable applied so that the subtracted capacity matches the Rated
            Capacity in every period.
