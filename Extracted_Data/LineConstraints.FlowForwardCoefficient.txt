Paragraphs:
Line Constraints Flow Forward Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient on the
          transmission line's flow in the reference direction, with flow in the
          counter-reference direction treated as zero.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:
