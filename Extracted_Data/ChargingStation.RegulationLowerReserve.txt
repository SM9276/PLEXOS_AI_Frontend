Paragraphs:
Charging Stations Regulation Lower Reserve is the provision of regulation lower reserve.
          This is provided in the same manner as Lower
            Reserve but to regulation type services. Note that provision of
          lower and regulation lower services is mutually exclusive by default i.e. the capacity reserved for one service cannot also be applied to the
          other.
