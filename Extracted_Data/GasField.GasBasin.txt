Description:	gas basins the gas field belongs to

Paragraphs:
Gas Field Gas Fields belong to basins and the basin might have overall limits on extractable gas, with a number of different Gas Fields candidates (and existing) inside the basin. Thus, a Gas Basin would act as a summary object for Gas Fields putting over-arching limits on the amount of gas that can be produced.
For example, if the basin has 1000 TJ of extractable gas there might be field development options that exceed this and the model needs to choose which projects are best.
