Header: Decision Variable Time Invariant

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	1
Validation Rule:	In (0,1,2,3)
Description:	Controls which aspects of the generic decision variable represent time-invariant values.

Paragraphs:
Decision Variable Time Invariant controls whether or not the generic decision variable represents a time-invariant value and which aspects of the variable are time invariant. This setting affects how the Lower Bound , Upper Bound and Objective Function Coefficient are interpreted in simulations where Horizon Periods per Day is non-hourly and also in simulation phases such as MT Schedule when intervals are combined together into multi-hour blocks.

The setting can take one of these values:
