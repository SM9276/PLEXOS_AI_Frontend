Paragraphs:
This property is used to scale the emissions from a generator that
          are defined using Emission Generators Production Rate .

Emissions on unit starts are scaled by the property Generator Start
            Fuels Emission
            Scalar .

Example

Two types of fuel are used in the generator, Gas and Diesel,
          producing two types of emissions, NOx
          and SO2.



The following table reflects the emission production rates by fuel
          (in lbs per MWh)

If Emission Generators Production
            Rate is used to determine emissions, then emissions are computed
          at the same rate for each fuel (which clearly is not the case). By
          attributing the emissions to the fuel being burned in the generator
          (using Emission Fuels Production
            Rate ), the proper emissions are computed for SO2,
          but not for NOx. For emissions such as
          NOx that are produced both as a function
          of the fuel used and the generator, the combination of properties
          Emission.Generators production rate and Generators.Fuels Emissions Scalar is
          used.

NOx is computed as the production
          rate for on generation multiplied by the emissions scalar for Gas of
          0.6 (1*.6=.6) on Gen1 and 0.8 (1*.8=.8) on Gen2, and for Diesel of 3
          (1*3=3) on Gen1. SO2 is computed based
          on units of fuel burned using the emission.fuel productions rates as
          input.
