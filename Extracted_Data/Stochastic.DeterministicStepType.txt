Description:	The step type for solving the final deterministic pass of the rolling horizon where "None" solves the entire horizon in one step

Paragraphs:
This setting applies to the final deterministic pass of a stochastic
          optimization solved with Rolling
            Horizon . The deterministic pass is performed after the rolling
          iterations and involves only the full branch samples (the final set of
          samples reported on). This pass sets storage trajectories based on the
          optimal stochastic outcome from the rolling iterations. Because this
          pass only solves the full branch samples by default it solves the
          entire horizon in a single step, but this option allows you to split
          the solve into steps for the case where the horizon is very long and
          solving the entire horizon would be slow or consume too much memory.
          The option can take the following values:

Note when solving in steps that the step length does not need to
          match up perfectly with the number of time periods in the horizon.
