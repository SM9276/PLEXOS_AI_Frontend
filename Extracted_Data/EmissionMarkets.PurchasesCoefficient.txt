Paragraphs:
Emission Markets Purchases Coefficient sets the emissions produced for each unit
          purchased from the market.

In the example in Table 1 the Emission "CO2" is produced by local
          fossil-fired generation, but in addition, imports from the Market
          "NEM" contribute at a rate equivalent to that of coal generation e.g. if imports are from another region that has predominantly coal-fired
          generation.
