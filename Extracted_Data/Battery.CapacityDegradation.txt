Paragraphs:
Battery Capacity Degradation is the degree to which battery capacity degrades with increasing numbers of cycles.

No degradation will occur within a single step. The cycles accumulated in each step result in degradation for following steps.

Example

In this example the Battery is initially 100 cycles old and degrades at a rate of 0.043% per cycle meaning that its initial degraded state is 95.7% and it will continue to degrade over the course of the simulation horizon as it accumulates cycles.
