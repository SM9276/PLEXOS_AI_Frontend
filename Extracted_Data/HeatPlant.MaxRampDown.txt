Paragraphs:
heat plant Max Ramp Down sets a limit on the amount that Heat Production can decrease and is expressed as the maximum ramp down rate in megawatts per hour. This limit applies for Heat Production ranges between Min Stable Level and Max Capacity .

For multi-unit generating stations the available ramp down is defined as:

By default the ramping limit is a hard constraint meaning that no violation is allowed.
