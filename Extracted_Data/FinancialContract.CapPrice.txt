Paragraphs:
Financial Contract Cap Price in a Gross Pool sets the price above which payments are made to the purchaser.

Example:

In this example the contract is 'active' when the market price exceeds $160/ MWh . When this happens the generator pays the purchaser the difference between the pool price and the contract price multiplied by the quantity.

See the Quantity topic for other examples.
