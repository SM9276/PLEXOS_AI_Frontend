Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Value to pass-through to solution

Paragraphs:
Region z is a multi-band value that is passed directly to the solution. The value is not involved in the simulation but is simply a pass-through datum. In summary the value is summed and divided by 1000. Pass-through properties that are attributed to Datafiles follow the slicing methods set in the LT/MT phases. Note, that in PASA , if resolution is different from Interval, i.e. if it's Daily or Weekly, then the output values will be coming from Daily or Weekly peak value hours/intervals and will not match the input hours/intervals values.

Note, that in PASA , if resolution is different from Interval, i.e. if it's Daily or Weekly, then the output values will be coming from Daily or Weekly peak value hours/intervals and will not match the input hours/intervals values.

Pass-through values are useful for benchmarking exercises allowing the convenient comparison of simulated versus actual values.
