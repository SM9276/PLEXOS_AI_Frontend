Paragraphs:
Facility Maintenance is the
                        production capacity on maintenance outage. This can be defined
                        using a Variable or passed as an
                        input from an Interleaved simulation to coordinate maintenance outages between models.

The definition of the Maintenance as an output varies by
                        simulation phase:

Maintenance reports the derating applied to capacity to
                                account for Maintenance Rate :

Maintenance = ∑ ( b ) ( Maintenance Rate b × ( Max Operating Level - Outage Rating b )

where: b indexes the bands
                                    of Maintenance Rate

Maintenance is the sum of the user-defined maintenance and
                                the 'idealized' maintenance profile:

Maintenance = Discrete Maintenance + Distributed Maintenance

Maintenance reports the capacity on maintenance from the
                                realized maintenance events (combination of user-defined and
                                those generated by PASA ). Thus
                                for any given event:

Maintenance =∑ ( b ) ( Max Operating Level - Outage Rating b )
                                × Units Out b

Note that if MT Schedule Chronology =
                                "Partial" then multiple discrete events may combine together
                                in any given period as a function of the slicing of the
                                duration curves and thus this profile may then resemble a
                                sculpted derating rather than discrete events.
