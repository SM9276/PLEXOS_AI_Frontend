Paragraphs:
Battery Discharge Transition Time
          sets the minimum time between operating in discharge mode and charge
          mode. By default, the battery can switch between modes from one
          interval to the next.



For the example in Table 1 the battery must wait at least one hour
          after discharging before it can charge or two hours to discharge after
          charging.
