Key Property:	No
Description:	Incremental cost of extracting gas from the pipeline

Paragraphs:
Gas Pipeline Flow Charge is the incremental cost of inserting gas at the pipeline receiving node. 
            Flow Charge is a multi-band property and can be used to specify different charges for different flow levels when used in conjunction with 
            Flow Charge Level. This is charged against the Flow forward in each interval. The total cost of 
            this charge is reported as Production Cost . When multiple bands are used, these should be
            specified in increasing order by cost. See also: Gas Pipeline Max Flow
