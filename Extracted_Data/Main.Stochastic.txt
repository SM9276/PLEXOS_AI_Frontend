Description:	Stochastic settings

Paragraphs:
See also Stochastic Property Reference for a detailed list of properties for this class of
          object.

Stochastic objects control:

Additional settings are available on the Global class to aid in the input of the scenario tree and hanging branches for stochastic
        optimization. There are also a number of Hidden Parameters related to stochastic settings.

Each simulation phase also has settings related to sampling and stochastic optimization. In particular, the option to
        model multiple independent samples, stochastic optimization, or simply the expected value case is controlled by the
        following phase switches:

Note that, even if your Stochastic object dictates that multiple samples are calculated for the input data, these phase
        settings control exactly how those samples are used.

To apply a Stochastic object to your Model add it to the Model's Stochastic collection.
