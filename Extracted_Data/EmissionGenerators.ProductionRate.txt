Key Property:	No
Description:	Emissions produced per MWh of generation
CCGT1	Units	1	-
CCGT1	Max Capacity	320	MW

"NOx" Generators "CCGT1"	Production Rate	1.25	kg/MWh

Paragraphs:
Emission Generators Production Rate defines the rate of emission production as a function of the megawatt Generation . This on top of emissions defined via the Generator Fuels membership and Fuel Production Rate .

Production Rate is useful for emissions such as " NOx " that are best expressed as a function of both Fuel Offtake and Generation .

Example



Setting Emission Production Using Load Points and Bands

The limit is "backward facing" for the following setting PLEXOS will allocate emission rates as follows:





PLEXOS will allocate the emissions as follows:



Note: The last block includes the value of Max Capacity of the generator. If this block is not included, no emission will be allocated for that block.
