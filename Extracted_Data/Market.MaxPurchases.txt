Paragraphs:
Market Max Purchases sets an upper
          bound on the amount bought from the market at the given Price in any interval. If you prefer to set a fixed supply from the market
          use the Supply property instead.

Note that when a supply curve is defined using Price and Quantity there is a natural
          upper bound on the purchases set by the Base
            Quantity less then lowest quantity point.

The example in Table 1 is a a daily exercisable buy option. Purchases
          are made in 25 MW blocks up to 200 MW at a price of $60/ MWh .
          The blocks are taken over the "HLH" timeslice e.g. peak
          periods.
