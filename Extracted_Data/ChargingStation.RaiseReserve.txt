Paragraphs:
Charging Stations Raise
          Reserve is the provision of raise ('spin up') reserve summed over all
          raise reserve types (raise,
          regulation raise and operational). Raise reserve is provided by
          reserving some Discharging capability from the Vehicle batteries when the SoC is above Min SoC . or by offering to
          reduce Charging of the
          battery. This is allowed only when the Max
            Discharge Rate is non-zero.
