Description:	If crossover is used to transform the interior solution produced by barrier into a basic solution

Paragraphs:
Crossover transforms the interior point solution produced by the
          barrier algorithm into a basic (corner point) solution. By default
          crossover occurs after every barrier solve. For large-scale linear and
          mixed integer programming problem e.g. like those produced
          by LT Plan , turning off the crossover
          is faster but the resulting solution, although optimal, is not a basic
          solution and can exhibit minor numeric issues.

Note that for a mixed integer optimization the crossover is required
          for the root relaxation. Turning off the crossover applies only to the
          final linear problem with integer variables fixed at their optimal
          values.
