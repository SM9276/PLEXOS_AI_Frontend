Description:	Coefficient of Commodity consumption at the Flow Node in the Constraint

Paragraphs:
Flow Node Constraints Consumption Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of the Consumption in the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × Flow
            Node Consumption ... {≤, ≥, =} b j
