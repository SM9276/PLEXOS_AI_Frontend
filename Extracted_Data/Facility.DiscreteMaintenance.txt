Paragraphs:
Facility Discrete Maintenance is
          an output of the PASA simulation phase.
          It reports the amount of maintenance that is defined via the Units
            Out property. These outages may be full or partial depending on
          the Outage Rating property.

Discrete maintenance events subtract from the overall maintenance
          requirement which is defined by Maintenance
            Rate and/or Maintenance
            Frequency . The remaining requirement is distributed 'optimally'
          according to the objective function of PASA and reported as Distributed
            Maintenance .
