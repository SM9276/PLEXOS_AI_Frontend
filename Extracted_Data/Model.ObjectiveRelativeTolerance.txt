Header: Model Objective Relative Tolerance

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Between 0 And 1
Description:	Allowable relative degradation for the objective when doing hierarchical multi-objective optimization for MIP models

Paragraphs:
During Hierarchical Multi-objective optimization, the highest priority objective is optimized (say minimized) first (say to a value X). While optimizing the second objective, we add a constraint obj1 <= X to make sure the first objective does not deteriorate relative tolerance if the ratio by which we allow this degradation.
