Paragraphs:
Facility Initial Production sets
          the initial ( t =0) production state of the facility i.e. the total production across all units. It is used to initialize
          constraints such as Max Ramp Up , Max Ramp Down , Min
            Up Time , Min Down Time , Max Up Time , and Max
            Down Time . This property is combined with Initial
            Units Operating and Initial
            Hours Up or Initial
            Hours Down when enforcing minimum/maximum up and down time
          constraints. If you omit Initial
            Units Operating then it is assumed that, if the initial
          production is non-zero, all available units are running, otherwise if
          Initial Production is zero then all units are off at t =0.

If Initial Production is not defined then the initial production is
          freely optimized i.e. a value is determined by the
          optimization that minimizes the impact of the initial conditions on
          the overall system cost.



In the example in Table 1 the production at t =0 is one unit
          operating at 500. Because the maximum ramp is 120 the unit can
          reach a maximum of 470 (350 + 120) or minimum of 230 (350 - 120)
          in the first hour. Additionally, the unit has been up for six hours
          and must continue operating for a further 12 to meet the minimum up
          time.
