Paragraphs:
Variable Activity is the total of
          the left hand side of the equation defining the conditional Variable. This is the value that is tested against the right-hand side
          (defined by Profile ) with the
          given Condition to determine if
          the expression is true or false.

Reporting the Activity allows you to see the full details of the
          expression. It is also useful to simply calculate a value based on the
          coefficients for use in reporting. Additionally, you can set another
          Variable equal to a conditional Variable and that Variable will take
          on the Activity (left-hand side) value.



In this example the left-hand side expression for the Variable
          "SA1.Renewables" sums up the Available
            Capacity of several Generator objects. The Variable Value is true
          if the sum is zero or false otherwise, and Activity is that sum of
          available capacity.
