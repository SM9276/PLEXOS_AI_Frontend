Description:	If transmission limits are filtered using extreme flows from MT Schedule

Paragraphs:
The aim of this feature is to remove redundant transmission limits (constraints) from the ST schedule phase.  It does this by decomposing the line flows from MT Schedule and builds a list of "extreme" flows, which are used to create a filtering criteria in ST Schedule .  This can considerably improve run-time by reducing the total amount of time spent in the problem optimization (i.e. this will reduce the problem size).
