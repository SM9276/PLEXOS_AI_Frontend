Paragraphs:
Facility Mean Time to Repair is
          used as the location parameter for several of the functions that
          generate outage duration samples for both forced and maintenance
          outages. The function used is set by the Repair
            Time Shape setting, which is described in the article Planned and Random Outages .



For the example in Table 1 all forced outages will have duration 8
          hours and maintenance outages 36 hours.
