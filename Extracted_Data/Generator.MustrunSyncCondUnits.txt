Paragraphs:
Generator Must-run Sync Cond Units is the number of units that are forced to run in synchronous condenser mode e.g. for reserve purposes.

Example:

In this example, the generator "HYDRO" is a single-unit generator that can operate in synchronous condenser mode. The conditional property dictates that it must run in synchronous condenser mode when the unit "G1" is out of service.
