Header: Transmission Enforce N-1 Contingencies

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	If N-1 contingencies should be automatically enforced.

Paragraphs:
Transmission Enforce N-1 Contingencies toggles on/off the N-1 contingency cases for all branches. It can take the following values:

Note that auto added contingency cases would monitor all the lines by default and slow down simulation speed. It is necessary to set a property voltage threshold by N-1 Contingency Voltage Threshold to reduce the case numbers.
