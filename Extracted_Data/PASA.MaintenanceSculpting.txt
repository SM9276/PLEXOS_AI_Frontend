Description:	Level of sculpting of maintenance outages: Higher sculpting means outages are more concentrated in high reserve periods

Paragraphs:
PASA Maintenance Sculpting controls the calculation of Maintenance Factor by the PASA algorithm. Higher values result in a greater bias towards periods of high capacity reserves .  The default value allows some maintenance outages to occur outside of high-reserve periods.

Note that the PASA Maintenance Sculpting will also be used in the calculation of Maintenance Factor by the LT Plan algorithm.
