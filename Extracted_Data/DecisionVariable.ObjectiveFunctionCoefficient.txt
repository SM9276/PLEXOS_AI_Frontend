Paragraphs:
Decision Variable Objective Function Coefficient represents a cost in the minimization objective function of the decision variables in the formulation. By default these are scaled by the number of hours in each simulation period.

Note that the coefficient may be scaled by the number of hours in each simulation period according to the setting of Time Invariant .

This is the key property for Decision Variable and thus can have Scenario applied to switch the element in/out of any running Model . Note that in order for the Decision Variable to be included in a simulation you must define one of Objective Function Coefficient or the following period variants even if you set the value to zero:

Example

The following variable is a continuous type with lower bound of zero and upper bound of 30. It is either optimized each interval or day depending on the Scenario in the running Model .
