Paragraphs:
Pumped storage plants store energy in the form of water, pumped from
          a lower elevation reservoir (the 'tail' storage) to a higher elevation
          ('head' storage). Low-cost off-peak electric power is used to run the
          pumps. During periods of high electric demand (and high price), the
          stored water is released through turbines to generate power. Although
          the losses of the pumping process make these plant a net consumer of
          energy overall, the system benefits from the arbitrage of cheap
          off-peak generation into the more expensive on-peak.

There is no specific 'type' setting for pumped storage hydro plant.
          Instead pumped storage is modelled using the Generator class and are identified by their unique data:

These two properties identify the Generator as a pumped storage, but you must also model the connected storages.
          Thus two Storage objects are required:

You need only define the Storage
            Max Volume on these storages. The following tables show a simple
          pumped storage plant and the required memberships between the
          Generator and the Storage objects.

The data in Tables 1 through Table 3 defines the pumped storage system
          illustrated in Figure 1. The left-hand diagram shows the generation
          cycle and how this affects the storages and the injection to the
          network. Likewise the right-hand diagram shows the pump cycle: note
          the effect of the efficiency such that a one megawatt load results in
          0.75 megawatt-hours of potential energy pumped to the head storage.

By default, the head storage will be assumed full, and the tail empty
          in the first hour of the simulation. You may override this using the Storage Initial Volume property of the head and tail storages as in Table 4.

The method used to value end-of-period storage is controlled by the Storage End Effects Method attribute. The default setting depends on whether or not the pumped
          storage is considered a 'simple' pumped system i.e. one that
          is not part of a cascading river network. Note: A cascade is a network of more than one interconnected
          storage. For 'simple' pumped storage systems, by default, the Storage End Effects Method for the
          head storage is "Recycle", which means the head storage level will
          return to its starting position at the end of each simulation step;
          and in a closed loop system like this it also implies that the tail
          storage will return to its starting level. Pumped storages that are part of cascading systems are treated the
          same as 'normal' storages and follow the rules shown in the article Cascading Hydro Networks which means you should set the Storage End Effects Method if the
          default is not appropriate.

Pumped storage release and pumping decisions are not decomposed by MT Schedule , which means their
          operation is independently optimized by ST
            Schedule . The reason for this is the load-duration curve model in MT
            Schedule does not (in general) capture the peak to off-peak
          price differentials that the full chronological model does, and thus
          it tends to understate the utilization of pumped storage. Thus the
          simulator leaves the optimization of pumped storage 'free' for ST
            Schedule . This has important implications for the chronological model's step
          size. If the ST Schedule step size
          is short (e.g. a day at a time) then arbitrage opportunities might be
          missed. It is normal practice then to model sufficient look-ahead in ST Schedule that the pumped storages
          can arbitrage across each week. This is achieved either through a
          weekly step size in ST Schedule ,
          or if that is not feasible computationally, then a daily step with
          additional days of look-ahead (potentially at a lower than hourly
          resolution).

Pumped storage can be subject to a number of technical limitations.
          Table 5 outlines the input properties available to model these
          constraints.



Returning to our hydro-thermal
            coordination problem: assume now that insert the pumped storage
          plant defined in the above tables in place of the energy-constrained
          and/or simple storage driven hydro plant.

Pumped storage with daily step: In this case we run ST Schedule alone with a step size of a day, meaning that the year-long horizon is
          solved in 365 steps each of 24 hours. The results are shown in Table
          6. Note that the total Energy increases due to the pump load, but
          overall there are net savings on thermal cost.

Pumped storage with weekly step: This case is the same as Case 5 but ST
            Schedule is configured to solve in weekly steps. In fact because
          weeks do not fit neatly into a year we are running 53 weeks and
          'discarding' the results for the last few days. The results for this
          case are shown in Table 7. Comparing these to Case 5, the weekly step
          size greatly improves the utilization of the pumped storage; in fact
          the capacity factor for the generator increases from 1.9% to 7.92%.
          Figure 11 compares a month of hourly pumped storage head storage
          volumes, and this shows very clearly the greatly increased utilization
          of the pumped storage in the weekly ST
            Schedule case. In conclusion, where the pumped storage plant is very large in
          comparison to the system as a whole, and where it has sufficient
          storage to perform arbitrage across a week it is important to run ST Schedule with more than a one-day
          step size and preferably up to a week.
