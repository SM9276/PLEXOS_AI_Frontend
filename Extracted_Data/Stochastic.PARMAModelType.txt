Units:	-
Default Value:	-1
Validation Rule:	In (-1,0,1)
Description:	PARMA Model Type (-1 = None, 0 = SARIMA model, 1 = PARMA model)

Paragraphs:
This option controls the use of PARMA during the constructions of
          samples for the scenario tree. The option can take the following
          values:

Seasonality in a time series is a regular pattern of changes that repeats over multiple time periods.
            For example, in monthly river flow data there is seasonality where in summer months the flow tends to
            be high and in winter months the flow is relatively low. While both SARIMA and PARMA models are
            capable of modelling a wide range of data with seasonal or periodic characteristics, evidence shows that 
            PARMA is more suitable than SARIMA in modeling series such as natural inflow. Users are recommended to conduct time 
            series analysis for the model selection before applying PARMA sampling to the specific property.
