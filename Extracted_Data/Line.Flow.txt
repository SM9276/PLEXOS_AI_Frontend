Paragraphs:
When reported by interval Line Flow is the power flow on the transmission line. Positive flow indicates flow in the 'reference direction' (from the Node From to the Node To ) whereas negative values are flows in the counter-reference direction. In the presence of losses the flow is the gross flow before losses.

In summary reporting (day/week/month/year) Flow is the sum of all non-zero flows in the reference direction. The property Flow Back reports the sum of flows in the counter-reference direction.
