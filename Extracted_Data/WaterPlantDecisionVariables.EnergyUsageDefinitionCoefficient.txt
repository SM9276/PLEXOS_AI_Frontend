Description:	Coefficient of the Decision Variable in the Water Plant Energy Usage definition equation

Paragraphs:
WaterPlant DecisionVariables Energy Usage Definition Coefficient is the coefficient of the DecisionVariable in the WaterPlant Energy Usage definition equation.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) and the WaterPlant value by x j , the following term is added to the formulation:

Thus a positive value of a (i,j) increases Energy Usage of the Plant and vice versa.
