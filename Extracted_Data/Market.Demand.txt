Paragraphs:
Market Demand defines a fixed hourly
          'demand' or exact amount of sales required in the Market. Shortages
          are priced at the Shortage Price while surpluses are priced at the Surplus
            Price .



For the example in Table 1 the profile of demand values  is read
          from an external Data File and
          scaled by a Variable . The Market
          must be supplied with the demand specified or incur a Shortage
            Cost of $10,000 per unit.
