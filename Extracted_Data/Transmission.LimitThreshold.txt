Header: Transmission Limit Threshold

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0.95
Validation Rule:	Between 0 And 1
Description:	Line, Transformer, or Interface flow loading threshold above which limits are added.

Paragraphs:
Transmission Limit Threshold is a tuning parameter for the iteration that checks transmission Line , Transformer and Interface limits. Reducing this value will result in limits be added earlier in the iterations, but might avoid iterations later in the simulation.
