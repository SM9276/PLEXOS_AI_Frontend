Paragraphs:
Generator Max Ramp Up sets a limit on the amount that generation can
          increase in any given interval, and is expressed in megawatts per
          minute. This property is multi-band which allows for different ramp
          limits depending on the generation level. If a single band is defined,
          then this limit applies for Generation ranges between Min Stable
            Level and Max Capacity ,
          unless Run Up Rate or Start
            Profile in which case this ramping limit applies after start up
          is complete.

To define different ramp limits depending on generation level, pair
          bands of the Max Ramp Up with Ramp
            Up Point .

For multi-unit generating stations the available ramp up is defined
          as:

When modelling Reserve the amount of
          available ramping up capability may be reduced by the provision of
          raise ancillary services. See the Response
            Ratio property for more details.

By default the ramping limit is a hard constraint meaning that no
          violation is allowed. To create soft constraints with a penalty price
          use the Max Ramp Up Penalty property.

To model the running up period where Generation is between zero and Min
            Stable Level use either the Start
            Profile or Run Up Rate properties.
