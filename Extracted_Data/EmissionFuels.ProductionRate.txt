Header: Emission Fuels Production Rate

Table Details:
Units:	kg/GJ (Metric), lb/MMBtu (U.S. Imperial)
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Emissions produced per unit of energy
CCGT1	Units	1	-
CCGT1	Max Capacity	320	MW
CCGT1	Heat Rate	7.9	GJ/MWh
"CO2" Fuels "Gas"	Production Rate	68.4	kg/GJ

Paragraphs:
Emission Fuels Production Rate defines the rate of emission production as a function of Fuel consumption ( Offtake ) and may include both the direct emissions from burning of the fuel as well as emissions associated with mining/extracting/transporting the fuel.

Example

Assume Generator " CCGT1 " uses Fuel "Gas" with:

Then 1 megawatt of Generation from " CCGT1 " will produce 68.4 Ã— 7.9 = 540.36 kg of " CO2 ".
