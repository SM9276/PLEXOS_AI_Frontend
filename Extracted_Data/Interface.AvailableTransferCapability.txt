Validation Rule:	
Key Property:	No
Description:	Available transfer capability on the interface.

Paragraphs:
Interface Available Transfer Capability is Available transfer capability remaining on the interface. Reported Available Transfer Capability will be on the same direction as the current interface Flow .

Interface Available Transfer Capability is calculated from the interface Flow and the defined Interface Lines Flow Coefficient / Flow Forward Coefficient / Flow Back Coefficient , k l .

If SCUC Enabled , then Interface Available Transfer Capability is calculate from the post-contingency power flow f x and the contingency shifter factors CSF .

In practice, the interface limit and interface Lines limits are all enforced. The interface ATC is reported as
