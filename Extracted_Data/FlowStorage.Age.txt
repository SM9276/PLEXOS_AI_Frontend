Paragraphs:
Flow Storage Age is the number
          of cycles completed in the given timeframe.

A complete charge and discharge ,
          between the specified Min SoC and Max SoC values, is
          considered to be a full cycle with the Age based on 'shallow discharging', where the storage can partially draw
          down and then refill.

Age = ( Withdrawal / Withdrawal
              Efficiency + Injection × Injection
              Efficiency ) × time / 2 × ( Max
            Inventory - Min
            Inventory )

The summary value of this property is simply the sum of the interval
          values.
