Paragraphs:
Generator Reference Generation is used to enter the reference generation case that will be used to distribute the 'slack' when calculating shift factors. These are only required if the appropriate Transmission PTDF Method is selected.

Example:

Note that PLEXOS will automatically normalize the reference generation case i.e. for a one megawatt injection at a generation bus i each generation bus ( j â‰  i ) is assigned the slack:
