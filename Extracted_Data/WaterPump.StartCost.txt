Paragraphs:
Water Pump Start Cost is the cost of starting a unit. 
          The cost of starting a unit is reported in the property Start & Shutdown Cost .

If no initial conditions are defined for a Water Pump, the start decision variable 
          for the first horizon period will not be included in the objective function. 
          This allows the optimization to assume a start occurred some time in the past 
          and so it can have a free start at the start of t=0.
