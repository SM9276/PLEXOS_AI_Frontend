Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Emission Coefficient sets the left-hand side coefficient of Generator Emissions Production in the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following term is added to the formulation:

where:

By default, this sum is taken over all Generator Emissions . However you can limit the set of Emissions included in the sum by adding Generator Emission memberships with no associated property definitions. This is a special case of using 'null' memberships to filter the terms included in another constraint property.
