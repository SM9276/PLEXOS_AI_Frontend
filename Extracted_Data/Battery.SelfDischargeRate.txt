Description:	Percentage of stored energy lost per hour due to self-discharge.

Paragraphs:
Battery self discharge rate models the rate of energy loss within the battery due to internal discharge effects. 
                Self discharge losses occur in the absence of any external connection: a battery does not need to be either Discharging or Charging through an external grid connection to experience self discharge losses.

Battery self discharge rate represents the percentage of storaged energy lost per hour. Self discharge losses are reported by Battery Self Discharge Losses .
                In addition, the the sum of self discharge losses and inverter inefficiency losses are reported by Battery Total Losses .
