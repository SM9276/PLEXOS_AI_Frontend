Paragraphs:
Generator Build Cost is the
              'overnight cost' of building a unit in LT
                Plan .

The Build Cost is treated as a 'lump sum' incurred when the unit
              is built, or an annuity if Economic
                Life and WACC (or Levelized
                Capital Carrying Rate ) are defined. Build Cost is defined
              per kilowatt of capacity so the total cost of building one unit
              is:

Cost ($) = ∑ Build Cost b ($/kW) × Max Capacity (MW) × 1000 (kW/MW)

Note that, the cost is also treated as a lump sum, if the Economic
                Life is entirely inside the planning horizon and the value
              of WACC is not the same as the Discount Rate .

For the example in Table 1, note how the property Max
                Units Built is used to define the number of units that can
              be built.

Build Cost is a multi-band property allowing you to model a
              stream of payments leading up to the commission date.

For the example in Table 2 a series of payments in three years
              leads up to the commission date implying that the project needs
              three years to be built.

Generator Build Cost as an
              output is the total cost of new builds and is calculated as:

Build Cost = Units
                Built × Build Cost (as calculated above from the input)

Notice that the reported Build Cost is the 'overnight cost'
              considering the input Build Cost in all bands. The output property Annualized Build Cost reports the build cost as an annuity.
