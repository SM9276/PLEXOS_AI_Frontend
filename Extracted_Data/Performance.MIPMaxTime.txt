Description:	Maximum time in mixed integer programming algorithm

Paragraphs:
Performance MIP Max Time is the
          maximum number of seconds spent solving any Mixed Integer Programming
          (MIP) problem. The optimization will continue until a solution is
          found that satisfies the MIP
            Relative Gap and MIP
            Absolute Gap criteria or this time limit is reached whichever
          comes first.

If the solver fails to find any feasible integer solution this time
          the linear relaxation is reported.
