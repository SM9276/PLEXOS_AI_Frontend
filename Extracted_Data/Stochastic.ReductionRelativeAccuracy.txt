Header: Stochastic Reduction Relative Accuracy

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	1
Validation Rule:	Between 0 And 1
Description:	Stop sample reduction when the accuracy of the reduced sample set drops to this level.

Paragraphs:
Stochastic Reduction Relative Accuracy, either alone or in combination with Reduced Sample Count , is used to invoke the Sample Reduction Algorithm . The default value of one means that no reduction will occur. Any number that is less than one but non-negative will cause the algorithm to reduce the samples after sampling and before simulation.
