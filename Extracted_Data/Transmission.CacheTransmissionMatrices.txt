Header: Transmission Cache Transmission Matrices

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	Cache the transmission matrices to disk for future use.

Paragraphs:
This flag controls whether or not the PTDF calculations (B-matrix, etc) are cached to disk for use in future simulations. If caching is allowed subsequent simulations of the same system will read the cached matrices which will improve runtime.
