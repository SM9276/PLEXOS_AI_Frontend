Paragraphs:
Generator Marginal Loss Factor(MLF) is a proxy for transmission losses from the station gate to the Regional Reference Node and is used in regional and uniform pricing models (see Generator Settlement Model i.e. where no specific modelling is done of intra-regional losses. The Marginal Loss Factor divides the Offer Price and Offer No Load Cost and multiplies the Price Received to account for those losses.

The pricing effect of Marginal Loss Factor is accounted for in the reported Cleared Offer Price and Cleared Offer Cost .
