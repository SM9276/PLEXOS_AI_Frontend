Paragraphs:
Facility Service Factor is the
          proportion of Installed
            Capacity that is available i.e. not on outage, and
          defined as:

Service Factor = 100 x ( Installed
            Capacity - Maintenance - Forced Outages ) / Installed
            Capacity

Note the definition allows for partial outages therefore even with a
          single unit facility the Service Factor can be fractional.
