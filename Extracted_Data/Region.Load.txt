Paragraphs:
Region Load defines input load
              at the region level which is then distributed to the Nodes in the Region with the Node Load Participation
                Factor property, and/or to Zones with the Zone Load Participation
                Factor when that Zone is part of a Region.

The following example reads the Load from a Data
                File .

Load is a multi-band property. This allows the definition of load
              in separate parts that will be added together. The following
              example defines loads for different classes of customer and
              applies different growth rates to those loads using an Variable .

Note that Price may also be used
              as an input to the simulation as an alternative to Load.

Region Load is the total load
              that occurred in the region defined as:

Load = ∑ Nodes ( Load )
