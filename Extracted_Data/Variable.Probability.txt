Paragraphs:
Variable Probability is the probability of exceedance (POE) of the exogenous (user-defined) sample in the given band.

Example

Assume a Variable can take one of two values, with probabilities of 80% and 20% respectively. The input for this simple case could look like the following:

Here the first band's value will be chosen approximately 80% of the time, whereas the band 2 value will be chosen only in the remainder of cases. Over a large sample size the average value of the sample will be 1.2.

Example

Assume now that there are three forecasts for a value given in three files with probability of exceedance of 10, 50 and 90 respectively. These can be defined as:

See the Variable topic for more details.

Another method to define the variable [Probability] is to consider it as cumulative probability of the exogenous (user-defined) sample in the given band, by setting the undocumented parameter Stochastic_CumulativeProbability as True (See Hidden Parameter ). In this method, the probabilities entered are numbers in the range of (0, 100%] and must be monotonically increasing along the bands (but not necessarily along the Profile values). The probability of the last band must be equal to 100%.

Example

To achieve the sample with the same probabilities of 80% and 20% for each band as indicated in the first example above, the input via this method should look like the following:

Example

Assume a Variable taking values from 1 to 10, with equal probability. The input via this method should be like:
