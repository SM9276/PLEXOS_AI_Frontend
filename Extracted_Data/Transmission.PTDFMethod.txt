Description:	Method for computation of shift factors

Paragraphs:
Transmission PTDF Method controls the method used to compute power transfer distribution factors (PTDF), or shift factors, as described in the article Optimal Power Flow Methods , and may take the following values:

The selection of slack bus(es) only affects the decomposition of locational marginal prices, not the absolute values. In PLEXOS the LMP components are reported in the properties Energy Charge , Congestion Charge , and Marginal Loss Charge .
