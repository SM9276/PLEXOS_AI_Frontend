Paragraphs:
Facility Max Units Built sets an
          upper limit on the number of new units that LT
            Plan is allowed to build in total across the entire planning
          horizon. For a Facility representing
          a discrete single-unit project this value should be set to one, as in
          the following example:

You can control when the new build is allowed to occur either by
          using the Project Start Date property or by using Max Units Built with a Date From tag as in this example:

In this example at most one new unit can be built in the planning
          horizon, but the new build cannot occur until the year 2030. You can
          controls whether the unit is built in particular years with Max
            Units Built in Year and/or Min
            Units Built in Year .

Max Units Built can be more than one to represent a multi-unit power
          station. For example, you might want to increase the number of units
          that is allowed to be built over time. However, it is important to
          note that Max Units Built is a cumulative number, so the dated series
          of values must be monotonically non-decreasing as in this example:



Note that LT Plan does not have to run on a calendar basis. If the planning horizon
            begins for example in July, it will run with planning years of June
            through July in which case the date tags should be consistent with
            this definition.
