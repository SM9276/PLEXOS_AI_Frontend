                than driving. For example, auxiliary consumption can represent power drawn from onboard air conditioning, entertainment systems
                and camera systems. The timing of this auxiliary consumption may differ to the timing of actual driving Demand .
                Energy to meet auxiliary consumption requirements is taken from the vehicle's Battery .

As an output, auxiliary consumption reports the input multiplied by the Units . Auxiliary consumption
                also contributes to the total Energy Consumption of the vehicle.
