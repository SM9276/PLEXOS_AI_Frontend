Header: Transformer Resistance

Table Details:
Units:	pu
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	A measure of the transformer's opposition to the flow of electric charge

Paragraphs:
Transformer Resistance is calculated as: Resistance (pu) = Resistance (actual) x MVA Base .It is used to determine the loss in the transformer: Loss = (Resistance / MVA Base) x (Flow) Â². Note that resistance with negative value will be considered as zero.
