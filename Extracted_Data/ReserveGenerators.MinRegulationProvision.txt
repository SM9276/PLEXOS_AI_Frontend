Description:	Minimum regulation reserve provision when units are in the regulation range

Paragraphs:
Reserve Generators Min Regulation Provision is the minimum regulation reserve provision when units are in the regulation range . The following constraint is added to the mathematical programming problem:

Thus the minimum applies only when the generator is 'on' and inside its regulation range .  Note further that if Reserve Unit Commitment is toggled 'on' then the above constraint is applied if-and-only-if the units are selected for reserve provision.
