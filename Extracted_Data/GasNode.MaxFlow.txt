Description:	Maximum flow through the gas node

Paragraphs:
Gas Node Max Flow is the maximum flow allowed through the Gas Node in any simulation interval. For a Gas Node to be an expansion candidate, the Max Flow must be defined.

If you need to set limits over other time frames use one of the following:
