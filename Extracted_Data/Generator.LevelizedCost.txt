Paragraphs:
Generator Levelized Cost isÂ 
          is a measure of the average net present cost of electricity generation
          for a facility over its lifetime. It is used for investment planning
          and to compare different methods of electricity generation on a
          consistent basis. The LCE "represents the average revenue per unit of
          electricity generated that would be required to recover the costs of
          building and operating a generating plant during an assumed financial
          life and duty cycle", and is calculated as the ratio between all the
          discounted costs over the lifetime of an electricity generating plant
          divided by a discounted sum of the actual energy amounts delivered

The value reported here is It is calculated as:

Levelized Cost = Total
            Cost / Generation

The Total Cost is the raw
          value without discounting, thus to compute the true LCE you should
          apply discounting.
