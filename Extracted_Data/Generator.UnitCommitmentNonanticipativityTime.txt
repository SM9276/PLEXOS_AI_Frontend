Key Property:	No
Description:	Window of time over which to enforce non-anticipativity constraints in scenario-wise decomposition

Paragraphs:
Generator Unit Commitment
          Non-anticipativity Time sets the time frame over which Unit
            Commitment decisions are non-anticipative in a stochastic
          optimization. This property must be used in conjunction with Unit
            Commitment Non-anticipativity .
