Description:	Number of additional look-ahead steps in the planning horizon

Paragraphs:
This attribute defines a look-ahead period in the Horizon .
          The total number of Step Type periods in the Horizon is thus Step Count + Look-ahead
          Count. For example, if Step Type is "Year" and Step Count 4 and
          Look-ahead Count 3 then the Horizon is 7 years long.

The look-ahead period only applies to MT
            Schedule when running Rolling
            Horizon or SDDP stochastic models.
          In all other cases look-ahead is treated the regular horizon. In
          stochastic models the look-ahead period is ignored when running the
          final deterministic pass of Rolling Horizon and the final forward pass
          of SDDP. This means the solution file will have not data for that
          look-ahead period. The purpose of this is to run additional time
          periods while iterating to find the optimal policy and the discarding
          those additional periods in reporting.
