Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Hours of Operation Coefficient is the coefficient of the number of
          hours of operation of the facility in the given period in the
          constraint.

This coefficient can be used to create a constraint that limits the
          number of hours of operation of a multi-unit facility.

For the example in Table 1 the facility is restricted to operating
          17.5 hours per day. Note that adding this coefficient causes the
          mathematical programming problem to include binary decision variables. And also note that
          the constraint may not be honoured in a linear relaxation 
            ( Unit Commitment ) when a partial unit is generating in one operating hour.

This constraint also may generate unexpected results in the partial chronology, since integer and temporal constraints are relaxed.
