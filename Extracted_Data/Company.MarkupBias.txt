Description:	Bias given towards high revenue periods in mark-ups (cost recovery algorithm)

Paragraphs:
Company Mark-up Bias is used in the LRMC Recovery algorithm in it's calculation of Generator Mark-up . It is used to bias mark-ups towards high revenue periods by changing the Revenue Recovery Factors, which are based on the profile of Generator Pool Revenue . This has the effect of tilting the resulting price duration curve to give higher peak and lower off-peak prices.

The effect of various values of Mark-up Bias on the revenue recovery factors is illustrated in Figure 1. Here a simple wave shape is increasingly biased as the value moves from 0 to 5.
