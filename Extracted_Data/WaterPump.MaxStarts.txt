Paragraphs:
Water Pump Max Starts (and its
          period-specific variants Hour , Day , Week , Month and Year )
          sets an upper bound on the number of Units
            Started in the given period.

The property is converted to a Constraint object with Water Pump Constraints Units
            Started Coefficient . The constraint requires modeling unit
          commitment and so only applies to chronological simulation
          phases. If the constraint period is longer than the ST
            Schedule optimization step size it will be decomposed by MT
            Schedule , however for this to work MT
            Schedule must be run in chronological mode i.e. not "partial" chronology but either "fitted"
          or "sampled". For example if you set Max Starts Year and your ST
            Schedule optimization step
          is one day, you must enable MT
            Schedule in the same run in chronological mode so the simulator
          can decompose the constraint to equivalent day limits.

By default this is a hard constraint, but can be made soft by
          defining the Max Starts
            Penalty .
