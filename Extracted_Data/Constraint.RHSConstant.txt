Description:	Right hand side RPN constant

Paragraphs:
Constraints RHS Constant defines
          a text expression that defines the right hand side of the constraint.
          This expression uses Reverse
            Polish Notation (RPN) and can involve any combination of values from:

A typical example of where this may be applied is when modelling
          transmission flow limits that depend on a complex combination of
          factors such as system inertia. The textual expressions on the
          right-hand side will be evaluated iteratively during the simulation.

Please note that the Constraint RHS property must also be defined. The evaluated RHS Constant value is added to the RHS value (which can of course be zero).

The RHS Constant value can change over time by using either the date
          from/to or the Timeslice fields. However it must be noted that the RPN
          expression cannot be aggregated for partial chronology. Therefore the
          RPN Constant is read at the beginning of each step and uses the first
          interval of that step to determine the expression used.

For more details information about the RPN syntax and usage please
          refer to the Concise
            Modelling Guide.
