Header: Node Injection Mismatch

Table Details:
Units:	MW
Mode:	Output Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	
Validation Rule:	
Key Property:	No
Description:	Absolute value of mismatch of injection due to PTDF threshold.

Paragraphs:
Node Injection Mismatch is the absolute value difference between Net Injections and net of Imports and Exports. Net Injection = |NetInjection + Imports - Exports| This value provides a measure of mismatch introduced due to the PTDF threshold. If the PTDF threshold is zero, Injection Mismatch will be zero as well. A non-zero threshold will result in a non-zero value for Injection Mismatch for some nodes. The magnitude of mismatch increases with the PTDF threshold.
