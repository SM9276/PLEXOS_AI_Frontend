Description:	Clear monitored constraints and variables from the formulation periodically (number of steps)

Paragraphs:
Instructs the simulator to clear any enforced monitored constraints
          and variables periodically. This includes dynamically enforced
          transmission limits which by default are carried over between
          simulation steps.  The setting can take the following values:

Clearing the monitored constraints and variables can improve
          performance if the problem grows large and is hard to solve at the
          start of each step, however clearing does result in more monitoring
          iterations, thus experimentation with this setting is needed to find
          the best value for your model.
