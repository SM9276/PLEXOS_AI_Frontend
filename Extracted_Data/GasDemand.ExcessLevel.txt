Paragraphs:
Gas Demand Excess Level is used to specify tiered bands with different Excess Price values. The levels are specified in cumulative amounts and are
            scaled based on the Gas Demand Resolution. If all the bands are used up PLEXOS will still allow more excess to occur at the
            excess price of the last band.
