Paragraphs:
PLEXOS models combined-cycle plant by explicitly tying the waste
          heat output of one or more units to the heat input of another unit.
          Specific features available in this model include:

The PLEXOS combined-cycle model is shown in Figure 1. In this
          representation:

this article follows and example based on a 2 x 1 setup with the
          following characteristics:

Table 1 presents the CT unit data for this case, Table 2 the ST data.
          For the example, assume there are two identical CT units (CT1 and
          CT2).

Note carefully that the ST total capacity is the sum of the 'normal'
          capacity plus duct burner capacity - we will discuss how to limit the
          duct burner contribution below. Assume that a fuel called GAS has been defined. Given this, the
          relevant memberships for the combined-cycle plant are shown in Table
          3. All three generating units use GAS (Point 1 in ). Note that the ST
          need not have a fuel membership because it receives waste heat from
          the CTs via the boiler, but this is included to model the duct-burner
          facility (Point 2 in ) i.e. the fuel burned by the ST will represent
          the duct burner use, with efficiency adjusted according to the boiler
          efficiency.

For clarity, this example is deliberately simplified, so it is
          important to note that you have access to all the usual generator
          modelling features for each of the CT and ST units and there are no
          preset limits on the configuration (2 × 1, 3 × 1, 4 × 1, etc).

Waste heat is 'transferred' from one generator to the next using the
          Generator Heat Input collection. In our example the ST unit takes
          waste heat from both CT1 and CT2 as defined by the memberships in
          Table 3. The amount of heat transferred from the CTs to the boiler is equal to
          the fuel input to the CTs less the electric output of the CTs (at
          notional maximum efficiency). Note that you should choose the
          appropriate metric or imperial units model (under Settings in PLEXOS)
          so that the efficiency conversion is computed consistent with the
          input heat model e.g. Using 100% efficiency equals 3.6 fuel units per
          megawatt hour in metric or 3.412 in imperial. The waste heat is then passed through the boiler before being used in
          the ST. The boiler is modelled as part of the ST and its efficiency is
          defined using the Boiler Efficiency property e.g. 80%. By default this
          efficiency is 100%. The ST unit will produce electric output from the steam output of the
          boiler according to its heat rate i.e. the steam input acts just like
          a 'free' fuel source. The waste heat produced by ST is the remaining
          energy after generation, which is defined differently from the input
          waste heat. (See Waste Heat) Additional fuel can be injected to the boiler (duct burner facility)
          as described below.

The ST unit cannot operate unless at least one of the CT units is
          operating. PLEXOS automatically enforces this rule when the Generator
          Heat Input membership is defined between the units. Generator outages may be modelled on CT and ST units in the usual
          manner - as described in [2]. Because PLEXOS explicitly models heat
          transfer the overall efficiency of the combined-cycle plant will
          correctly account for the number of CTs on-line and the heat rate as a
          function of the CT and ST units. When all CT units are out of service the ST will not operate, however
          the CT units may operate independently of the ST - but would only do
          so if the price they receive is high enough to at least compensate
          them at their raw CT heat rate.

Some combined-cycle plant can boost generation from the ST part by
          injecting fuel into the ST. This duct burner facility is modelled in
          PLEXOS by adding a fuel membership to the ST unit, as in Table 3. By default the duct burner capacity would be limited only by the ST
          capacity so we use the property Generator Fuels Max Input to set a
          limit on the fuel injected into the duct burner, as in Table 4. The
          figure of 625 is the ST heat rate multiplied by the 50 MW capacity of
          the duct burner. Note that the fuel injected at the duct burner enters AFTER the boiler
          and thus is NOT subject to the efficiency of the boiler component.

Need to provide example database for this case. Now assume that the combined-cycle plant generates into an external
          energy market with an uncertain forward price. The illustrations below
          present a selection of the results from a sample week. Referring to Figure 2 it is clear that the automatic logic constraints
          that PLEXOS produces that control when the steam turbine can operate
          are in force; also the steam turbine output varies according to how
          much waste heat is coming from the CT units, and this is a function of
          their loading level and heat rate. The noticeable spike in ST output
          during high priced periods Figure 3) is produced by the duct burner
          capability and this is easily seen from the fuel offtake results
          (Figure 4) in which the ST unit only uses fuel when it is utilizing
          the duct burner facility.

Both CT and ST units may provide reserve-as described here .

An exogenous heat load can be placed on the ST unit using the
          property Heat Load described in [4], and this is useful for modelling
          co-generation plant. This load will always be met if physically
          feasible. PLEXOS can also arbitrage optimally between electric production and
          supply of heat to an external heat market (which might represent a
          contract to supply district heating for example)-these options are
          described in Market class.

Another alternative way to model the CCGT from PLEXOS 7.6 version is
          using the new heat class feature. GT generators are connected to a heat node via Heat
            Output Nodes membership. ST generators are linked to the same
          heat node via Heat Input Nodes membership. The auxiliary boiler can be
          modelled by the Heat Plant class.
          See Heat Modelling for more
          details.

When there are 2 or more GT generators connecting to a same ST
          generator (or even more ST), there exists several CCGT configurations
          or combinations. For example, 1 GT runs with the ST or 2 GTs runs
          parallel with ST. Currently, PLEXOS does not model the configuration
          specifically. However, it can be achieved using the Generic
          constraints and Decision Variables. This section presents an example
          on how to model the CCGT configuration for 3 GT and 1 ST. Please
          contact Energy Exemplar staff for a copy of the example model. In this example, we model 3 GT and one ST. There are 3 possible
          configurations for this CCGT operation.

Creating 3 decision variables (called GT1alone, GT1+GT2, GT1+G2+GT3).
          They are all binary decision variables (Type = Integer, Lower bound =
          0, Upper Bound = 1).

GT1Alone =⁢ [UnitGeneratingCoefficient]_GT1 G1Alone + [UnitGeneratingCoefficient]_GT2 =< 1 G1Alone + [UnitGeneratingCoefficient]_GT3 =< 1

GT1&GT2&GT3 =< (UnitGeneratingCoefficient]_GT1 +
          UnitGeneratingCoefficient]_GT2+ UnitGeneratingCoefficient]_GT3)/3 GT1&GT2&GT3 =< (UnitGeneratingCoefficient]_GT1 +
          UnitGeneratingCoefficient]_GT2+ UnitGeneratingCoefficient]_GT3) - 2.99

GT1Alone + GT1Alone + (GT1&GT2) + (GT1&GT2&GT3) =< 1 With the above constraints and decision variables, we can know which
          configuration is active.

If there is any special CCGT configuration rule required, additional
          constraints can be added using the above decision variables. For example, we can't move from state GT1&GT2&GT3 to GT1alone
          and vice versa. In this case, we need to write this constraint (using
          time lag) GT1Alone(t-1) + GT1&GT2&GT3(t) =<1

Another common requirement is modelling the transition time from one
          configuration to another. For example, the transition from state
          GT1Alone to GT1&GT2 is 45 minute. First of all, we need to know
          the number of intervals covering the transition time. N = [Transition
          Time]/[Interval length]. Says the simulation interval is 15 minute, we
          have N = 45/15 = 3 Using the time lag feature, we will write N generic
          constraints as: GT1Alone(t) + GT1&GT2(t) =< 1 (1) GT1Alone(t) + GT1&GT2(t+1) =<1 (2) ... GT1Alone(t)+ GT1&GT2(t+N) =<1 (N) This means that if GT1Alone is active, the next 3 intervals (45
          minutes), state GT1&GT2 cannot be used.
