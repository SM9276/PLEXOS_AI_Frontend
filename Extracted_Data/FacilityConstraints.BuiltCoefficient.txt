Description:	Coefficient on binary variable indicating if any capacity is built to date

Paragraphs:
Facility Constraints Built Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient on the binary
          (0,1) variable indicating if any capacity is built to date in LT Plan .

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × ∑ ( t = 1, k ) (If( Facility Units Built t = 0, 0, 1)) ... {≤, ≥, =} b j

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation
