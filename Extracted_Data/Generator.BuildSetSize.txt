Paragraphs:
Setting Generator Build Set Size
          to a non-zero value indicates that expansion must occur in sets of
          this many units.

In this example the Generator is
          defined as 1 MW "units" that must be built in sets of 50 at a time.
          Thus 0, 50, 100, 150 only is feasible for Units
            Built .

Note that this set size constraint is ignored if Expansion
            Optimality is "Linear Relaxation" or in years outside the LT
            Plan Integerization
            Horizon .
