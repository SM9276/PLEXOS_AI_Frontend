Description:	Maximum amount of gas that can be injected into the storage in any interval when defining a gas storage ratchet.

Paragraphs:
Gas Storage Injection Ratchet is the maximum amount of gas that can be injected into a storage unit at a time. The resolution of this property depends on the Gas Demand Resolution property. If the Gas Demand Resolution is set to Interval, the Injection Ratchet specifies the maximum amount of gas that can be injected in an interval. Likewise, if the Gas Demand Resolution is set to Hourly or Daily, the Injection Ratchet specifies the maximum amount of gas that can be injected in an hour or day, respectively.

Note that the Injection Rate Scalar property can further limit gas injection into a storage unit.
