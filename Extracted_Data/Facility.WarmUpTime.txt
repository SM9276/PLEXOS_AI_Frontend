Paragraphs:
Facility Warm Up Time is the
          number of hours required to warm up the Facility. The warm up period
          is triggered when there are any number of Units
            Started after a period where Units
            Operating is zero. During the warm-up period, only the Warm
            Up Process runs i.e. Production is zero and the Warm Up Process runs at the output level set by the Warm
            Up Operating Level .

The number of hours spent warming up is reported in the Warm Up Hours output property.

When Warm Up Time is combined with Min Down Time the warm up
          behaviour changes as follows:

In the above example, the Facility must warm up for 48 hours unless
          it has been off for no more than four hours in which case it can warm
          up in four hours.
Lists:
	- The Min Down Time constraint is ignored
	- The Min Down Time becomes a trigger point at which the warm up
            period can be interrupted if the unit has been off for no longer
            than the Min Down Time hours.
