Default Value:	-1
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Price for violating non-anticipativity constraints in scenario-wise decomposition mode

Paragraphs:
Physical Contract Build Non-anticipativity sets the price for violating the non-anticipativity constraints when LT Plan is run in scenario-wise decomposition mode according to the Stochastic Method attribute. The default value of -1 means that the non-anticipativity constraints are hard constraints. A value of zero means the constraints can be violated at no cost, and any positive value sets a penalty for violating the constraints.
