Description:	Demand bid slope for modeling elasticity. Must be entered to auto-generate steps.

Paragraphs:
Gas Demand Bid Slope is Demand bid slope for modeling elasticity. 
          Must be entered to auto-generate steps along the demand step function. Along with Bid Quantity and Bid Price , the demand step function is generated using the point slope formula: y-p = m(x-q) where m is the Bid Slope and p and q are the Bid Price and Quantity.

y-p = m(x-q)
