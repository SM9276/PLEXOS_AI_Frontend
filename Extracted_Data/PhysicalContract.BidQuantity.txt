Paragraphs:
Physical Contract Bid Quantity defines the quantity part of the load bid at the Load Node .

Example:

Bid Price defines the price part of the load bid. Higher values will clear first i.e. in this example the 70 MW load will clear unless the energy price exceeds $10000/ MWh , the additional 5 MW load however will only dispatch if the energy price is less than or equal to $500/ MWh , above that price that load will not be met.

You can place lower and upper bounds on the load dispatched using the Min Load and Max Load properties.
