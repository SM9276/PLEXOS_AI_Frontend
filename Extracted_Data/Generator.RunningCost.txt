Description:	Fixed cost of running a generating unit when on-line

Paragraphs:
Generator Running Cost is an
          additional cost (over and above fuel and VO&M
            Charge ) incurred for each hour that a unit is on-line. The cost
          is not incurred if the unit is off-line, thus this is a 'semi-fixed
          cost'. This cost is reported as part of Generation
            Cost .
