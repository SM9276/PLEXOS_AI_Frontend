Paragraphs:
See also MLF Property Reference for a detailed list of properties for this class of object.

This class is specifically designed for the Australian NEM. NEM loss equations include terms for regional demand as well as flow. The simulator (like the NEM market-clearing engine) approximates the loss function with a multi-tranche linear approximation.

You enter the MLF equations directly into the model using special MLF objects, and the simulator will calculate the loss function accounting for all factors including region demand, and from those function generates a linear approximation. This approach has the advantage that loss functions on the interregional interconnectors are calculated every period, ensuring that the simulated losses and interregional prices are as close as possible to an emulation of the market. There is no significant additional overhead or iteration required, so this is a also very efficient approach.

Example:

Interconnector losses are attributed to the sending and receiving regions in certain proportions. In the Australian NEM, these proportions are fixed constants. Line objects include the property Loss Allocation . By default, this allocation is 0.5, which means losses are attributed evenly to the sending and receiving nodes . The value may be set to any value between zero and one with values above 0.5 meaning that more losses are assigned to the receiving node .

Example:

Note that losses for the SNOWY1 interconnector are 'normally' allocated in part to Snowy (10%) and NSW (90%), and likewise for V-SN, but for medium term modelling purposes, where no load is attributed to the Snowy region, these allocation factors should be consistent in not allocating any load to Snowy. For short-term modelling, where load are input for Snowy the 'normal' factors should be used (Snowy1 0.95/0.05, V-SN 0.10/0.90).

The NEM uses 10-piece linear loss functions across the entire range of feasible flows, notionally treating maximum import as the 'zero-point' for the approximation. The Transmission setting Max Loss Tranches determines how many loss tranches are used in each direction of flow. Thus, setting this value to 5 will replicate the approach used in the NEM.

The following pictures capture the dynamic MLF and loss approximation over a one-year simulation. There are eight graphs, two for each interconnector. The first chart in the set plots line flow versus loss, treating flows in the 'back' direction as notionally negative. The second chart shows the marginal loss factor (as reported under Marginal Loss Factor ). This graph shows clearly the steps in the linear approximation. The green points are the MLF calculated using the 'raw' MLF equations above. The spread of points on each chart shows the amount of variation in the MLF equations due to the dynamic demand elements.
