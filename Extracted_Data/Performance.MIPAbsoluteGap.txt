Header: Performance MIP Absolute Gap

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Description:	Absolute tolerance on the gap between the best integer objective and the objective of the best node remaining

Paragraphs:
Performance Absolute MIP Gap is a
          solver setting for the mixed integer optimizer. The default value of
          zero means the solver's default gap will be used. Values above zero
          will be passed to the solver.

This sets an absolute tolerance on the gap between the best integer
          objective and the objective of the best node remaining. When this
          difference falls below the value of this parameter, the mixed integer
          optimization is stopped.
