Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Heat Production Coefficient connects to the heat production of the generator.

For CHP units this is the left-hand side coefficient of Heat Production in the constraint, and for other units, such as normal thermal generators, it is the coefficient of Waste Heat .

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following term is added to the formulation:
