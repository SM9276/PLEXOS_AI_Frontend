Description:	Method used to handle end-of-period storage.

Paragraphs:
Storage End Effects Method controls
          the treatment of the final End
            Volume of each simulation step, and how Waterway flows-in-transit are valued or
          constrained in the optimization. The switch can take these values:

Note that when LT Plan and/or MT
            Schedule are run before ST
            Schedule End Effects Method = "Recycle" applies only to the
          first simulation phase unless Decomposition
            Method is set to "None". For example MT
            Schedule would recycle storage over each year and pass targets
          to ST Schedule that follow this
          recycling trajectory.
