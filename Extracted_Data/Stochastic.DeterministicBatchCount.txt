Header: Stochastic Deterministic Batch Count

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	1
Validation Rule:	â‰¥1
Description:	For Deterministic Step Type = "None" the samples in the deterministic phase will be divided into this number of batches

Paragraphs:
This setting applies to the final deterministic pass of a stochastic
          optimization solved with Rolling
            Horizon . It applies when Deterministic
            Step Type = "None" which causes the entire horizon is solved in
          a single step and all samples solved in parallel. For long horizons
          and/or a large number of samples this can consume considerable memory.
          This option allows you to split the samples into a number of batches
          which are solved in sequence.
