Paragraphs:
Region Constraints Generation Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of the total Region Generators Generation in the constraint
          on a generator-terminal basis i.e. without any adjustment
          for Auxiliary Use .

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:
