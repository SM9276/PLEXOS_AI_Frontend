Paragraphs:
Generator Monopoly Rent is the
          additional profit earned by the Battery due to the selected strategic bidding algorithm, and defined as:

Monopoly Rent = ( Generation
            Revenue - Cost to Load ) -
          ( Shadow Generation
            Revenue - Shadow Cost
            to Load )

Generally this value would be positive, meaning that strategic
          bidding increased profits, but in some cases it can be negative e.g. if mark-ups are so high that volume is lost or if the battery is part
          of a Company whose overall Net
            Profit has increased.
