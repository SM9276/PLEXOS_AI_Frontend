A Flow Network flows a single Commodity through a collection of Flow Node objects linked by Flow Path objects,
          with optional storage in Flow Storage objects.

Figure 1 shows a three node network in which a Facility "Plant" produces a Commodity "Water" that flows on the network from the "Source" node to the "Sink"
          node where it is sold in a Market . The
          Flow Path from "Source" to "Sink" is limited in capacity but the
          market can be reach via the "Bypass" node along a different set of
          Flow Path objects but there is a cost associated with flows through
          that node.

Figure 1: Flow Network Example

Table 1 lists the objects for this example, Table 2 the memberships
          and Table 3 the properties.







A Flow Network can have connections to other networks through the
          following memberships:

These connections allow you to import/export to/from your external
          electric network to the Flow Network.
