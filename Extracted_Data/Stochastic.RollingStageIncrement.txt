Default Value:	-1
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Description:	Number of stages rolled forward each iteration where -1 means this is automatically determined based on the scenario tree

Paragraphs:
This option applies to models with a scenario tree solved using Stochastic
            Algorithm = "Rolling Horizon". Please refer to Multi-stage
            Stochastic Optimization for more information on solving models
          with scenarios trees. The Rolling Stage Increment sets how many stages
          (weeks or months) of each iteration of the Rolling Horizon contain
          branching. By default this is automatically determined based on the
          probabilities in the scenario tree (see Minimum
            Sample Weight ), but you can override the default and force the
          Rolling Horizon method to branch over more or less stages in each
          iteration.

Example:

Consider the progress messages from this Rolling Horizon simulation
          with default settings:

Each iteration considers branching over five stages ("Branching
          Stages 1-5"). If we set Rolling Stage Increment to 10, then the number
          of iterations will be halved and the length of each iteration in terms
          of branching will double.

Note that increasing the number of branching stages inevitably leads
          to numerical instability as the probabilities expressed in the
          optimization objective function become tiny.
