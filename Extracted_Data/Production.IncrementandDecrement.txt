Description:	If simultaneous closure of increment and decrement bids/offers around a base is allowed

Paragraphs:
In Balancing Markets , increment and decrement offers and bids are commonly defined relative to an Offer Base or Bid Base . It is possible to define 'degenerate' increment and
                decrement offers and bids. Degenerate offer/bid clearing corresponds to clearing multiple bid and/or offer bands simultaneously in a way that reduces system cost but does not actually
                change Net Generation . Possible degenerate offers and bids include:

Generators which can pump and generate as well as Batteries can also experience degenerate clearing through bid/offer interactions:

This setting prevents the degenerate clearing of offers and bids across all offers and/or bids defined around a base. This prevention introduces integers to the formulation and may have performance impacts.

This model-wide setting can be overriden for individual objects with Generator Simultaneous Increment and Decrement and Battery Simultaneous Increment and Decrement .
Lists:
	- Degenerate offer: an increment offer band can be cleared with a decrement offer band profitably,
	- Degenerate bid: an increment bid band can be cleared with a decrement bid band profitably.
	- Degenerate increment: an increment offer band can be cleared with a increment bid band profitably,
	- Degenerate decrement: a decrement offer band can be cleared with a decrement bid band profitably.
