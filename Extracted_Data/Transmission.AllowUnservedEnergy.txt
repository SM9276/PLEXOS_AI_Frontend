Description:	Model Unserved Energy in OPF

Paragraphs:
Transmission Allow Unserved Energy is the master on/off switch for modelling of Unserved Energy .

Unserved energy occurs when generation capacity is not sufficient to meet the input load.  By default unserved energy is a possibility at every Load point in the transmission network. The unserved energy acts like a generator with price equal to the interval value of lost load (VoLL) , and reported at the accounting value of Region VoLL . Therefore turning off this option can improve performance, but if unserved energy is needed the simulation will be infeasible without it.

Note that inclusion of unserved energy variables can be controlled to the Node level using the Node Allow Unserved Energy property.

You can further control the Node objects with unserved energy formulated using the USE Threshold setting.
