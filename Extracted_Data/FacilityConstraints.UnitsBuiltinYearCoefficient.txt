Description:	Coefficient of number of units built in the year

Paragraphs:
Facility Constraints Built in Year Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient on the
          binary (0,1) variable indicating if any inventory capacity is built in
            the year in LT Plan .

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × If( Facility Units Built t = 0, 0, 1) ... {≤, ≥, =} b j

where: t is the given period e.g. year of the simulation
