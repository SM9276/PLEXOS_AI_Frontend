Paragraphs:
Generator Shutdown Penalty is a
          penalty applied to shutting down a unit that is additional to the
          normal Shutdown Cost but is
          not included in the reported Start
            & Shutdown Cost . This penalty can be used to affect the
          optimal unit commitment by either increasing or decreasing a unit's
          apparent shutdown cost while not affecting the reported costs.
