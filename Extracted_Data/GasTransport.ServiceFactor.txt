Paragraphs:
Gas Transport Service Factor is the
          proportion of Gas Transport capacity that is available, i.e. , not
          on outage, and defined as:

Service Factor = 100 x ( Max Volume - Maintenance - Forced Outages ) / Max Volume

Note the definition allows for partial outages therefore the Service Factor can be fractional.
