Paragraphs:
Battery Min Down Time is the minimum number of hours a battery must have zero discharge after discharging stops. It is based only on discharging, not charging.
                Min Down Time is a static property. If it is defined dynamically (varying according to different periods), the maximum value will be used.

Note: It is recommended to set the Min Discharge Level to a value greater than 0 when this property is used.
