Paragraphs:
Battery Min Up Time is the minimum number of hours a battery must discharge after discharging starts. It is based only on discharging, not charging.
                Min Up Time is a static property. If it is defined dynamically (varying according to different periods), the maximum value will be used.

Note: It is recommended to set the Min Discharge Level to a value greater than 0 when this property is used.
