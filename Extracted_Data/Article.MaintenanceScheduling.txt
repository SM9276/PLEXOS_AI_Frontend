Paragraphs:
The simulator can model random outages for Generator, Line, Gas
          Pipeline and Water Pipeline objects for use in a Monte Carlo
          simulation. Partial and full outages are supported. Outages occur at a
          frequency controlled by the user-defined forced outage rate which in
          combination with an expected outage duration implies a mean time
          between failures (MTBF).

The expected number, timing, and severity (duration and size) of
          outages is determined by the Forced
            Outage Rate , the repair
            time distribution and the Outage
            Rating . By default, Forced Outage Rate is the fraction of time that units at
          the generator are expected to be unavailable due to random failures.
          For example, an outage rate of 10% means that over the course of one
          year the units are out-of-service for 0.1 × 365 = 36.5 days. The input
          outage rate may vary over time e.g. annually, seasonally or monthly
          but not more frequently than the resolution of PASA as controlled by the Step Type setting. Forced Outage Rate can, alternatively, be input as a percentage of
          Operating Hours rather than total hours. For example, a 10% outage
          rate would mean that in 10% of hours where a unit is either operating
          or intending to operate it out-of-service. The Generator setting
          Forced Outage Rate Denominator controls this forced outage rate
          interpretation. This has been developed with reference to the EFORd
          formula of IEEE Standard [1], in which EFORd stands for Equivalent
          Forced Outage Rate on demand and it is an industry standard index for
          evaluating generating unit performance in competitive markets. Finally, forced outage rate can be linked to planned outages (defined
          by Units Out) with the setting EFOR Maintenance Adjust. Note that it is possible to have different repair time distributions
          for forced and maintenance outages by putting the Forced Outage Rate
          and Maintenance Rate on different band numbers. See the Maintenance
            Rate property for examples. Forced outage events are automatically created by the simulator for
          all generators with Forced Outage Rate defined. However if the repair
          time distribution is omitted then a warning will be issued by the
          simulator and no outages will be modelled for those objects i.e. you
          must define at a minimum the Mean Time to Repair. The random number generator for each outage object (generator, line,
          etc) is initialized from the Model Random Number Seed, which itself is
          randomly generated if not defined. If you want finer control on the
          seeding of each outage object you can set the Random Number Seed for
          each object. The Diagnostic Random Number Seed outputs the seeds read
          or created to a text file. Thus to repeat the sequence of random outages used in a simulation set
          the Model Random Number Seed property. Because the stream of random numbers used depends on the
          number of outage elements in the system you might get a different set
          of outage patterns if you add or remove some elements. To avoid this
          problem you may set the Generator Random
            Number Seed directly on each object causing them to seed
          independently. The automatic generation of forced outages can be switched on/off
          using the setting Stochastic
            Outage Scope .

When an element goes out of service it takes some finite time to
          repair. The time taken usually follows a known distribution with you
          can derive from historical data. The simulator implements a wide range
          of distribution types for repair time:

Repair times are constant (always the same duration). Parameters required to model constant distribution: T ~(μ)

where: The location parameter μ is the
            constant repair time.

For the example in Table 1 the element is out of service on average
          9% of the year and each outage event will be 8 hours long.

Repair times vary in length uniformly from a minimum and maximum
          value.

a ~ The minimum repair time b ~ The maximum repair time

Parameters required to model uniform distribution: T ~(μ, σ) The location parameter, μ = a The scale parameter, σ = b - a For a < t < b

Probability density function: f(t) = 1 / σ

Cumulative distribution function: F(t) = (t - μ) / σ

Inverse cumulative distribution function: tp = μ + σp

Expected value: E(T) = μ + σ / 2

For the example in Table 2 the element is out of service on average
          9% of the year and outage events vary in duration from 6 to 36 hours
          with uniform probability.

Repair time happens from a minimum to a maximum value with the mode
          value known.

a ~ The minimum repair time b ~ The maximum repair time c ~ The mode repair time

Parameters required to model triangular distribution: tp = μ + σp The location parameter, μ = a The scale parameter, σ = b - a The shape parameter, κ = (c - a) / (b
            - a)

For a < t < b

Probability density function: f(t) = 2(t-μ) / σ2κ for t ≤ c f(t) = 2(μ+σ-t) / σ2(1-κ) for t ≥ c

Cumulative distribution function: F(t) = (t - μ)2 / σ2κ for t ≤ c F(t) = 1 - (μ+σ-t)2 / σ2(1-κ) for t ≥
            c

Inverse cumulative distribution function: tp = μ + σ√(κp) for p ≤ κ tp = μ + σ(1-√[(1-κ)(1-p)]) for p ≥ κ

Expected value: E(T) = μ + σ(1+κ) / 3

For the example in Table 3 the element is out of service on
          average 9% of the year and outage events vary in duration from 6 to 36
          hours with 12 hours being the highest frequency.

Repair times happen at a constant average rate, λ. That is, it does
          not matter how long the time since the last failure, the repair time
          will be the same. It is commonly used for high quality electronic
          circuits, or for components that exhibit wearout only after the
          expected technological life of the component.

a ~ The minimum repair time λ ~ The rate parameter

Parameters required by PLEXOS to model exponential distribution: T ~(μ, σ) The location parameter, μ = a The scale parameter, σ = 1 / λ

For t > μ

Probability density function: f(t) = exp(-(t-μ)/σ) / σ

Cumulative distribution function: F(t) = 1 - exp(-(t-μ)/σ)

Inverse cumulative distribution function: tp = μ - σ.ln(1-p)

Expected value: E(T) = μ + σ

In the following example the element is out of service on average 9%
          of the year and outage events with minimum duration of 6 hours and the
          rate of 1.

Parameters required to model Weibull distribution: T ~(μ, σ, κ) The minimum repair time, μ The scale parameter, σ The shape parameter, κ

Probability density function: f(t) =
            (κ/σ)[(t-μ)/σ]κ-1exp(-[(t-μ)/σ]κ)

Cumulative distribution function: F(t) = 1 - exp(-[(t-μ)/σ]κ)

Inverse cumulative distribution function: tp = μ + σ.(-ln(1-p))1/κ

Expected value: E(T) = μ + σ.Γ(1+1/κ)

where gamma function, Γ(z) = ∫tz-1.e-tdt from 0 to ∞

In the following example the element is out of service on average 9%
          of the year and outage events with minimum duration of 6 hours, the
          shape parameter of 2 and the scale parameter of 1.

It is useful for modelling components with a decreasing repair time
          (due to a small proportion of defects in the population). It is used
          to describe time to failure for certain degradation processes.

Parameters required by PLEXOS to model Lognormal distribution: The minimum repair time, μ The scale parameter, σ The shape parameter, κ

For t > μ

Probability density function: f(t) = (1/κ(t-μ)).φ nor ([ln(t-μ)-σ]/κ)

Cumulative distribution function: F(t) = Φ nor ([ln(t-μ)-σ]/κ)

Inverse cumulative distribution function: tp = μ + exp(σ+κ.Φ nor -1 (p))

Expected value: E(T) = μ + exp(σ+κ2/2)



In the following example the element is out of service on average 9%
          of the year and outage events with minimum duration of 6 hours, the
          shape parameter of 2 and the scale parameter of 1.

It can be used to model components with an increasing repair time.

Parameters required by PLEXOS to model SEV distribution: T ~(μ, σ) The location parameter, μ The scale parameter, σ

For -∞ < t < ∞

Probability density function: f(t) = (1/σ).exp((t-μ)/σ -
            exp((t-μ)/σ))

Cumulative distribution function: F(t) = 1 - exp(-exp((t-μ)/σ))

Inverse cumulative distribution function: tp = μ + σ.ln(-ln(1-p))

Expected value: E(T) = μ - 0.5772.σ

In the following example the element is out of service on average 9%
          of the year and outage events with the location parameter of 6 hours
          and the scale parameter of 1.

It can be used to model components with an increasing repair time
          which remains constant after a period of time.

Parameters required by PLEXOS to model LEV distribution: T ~(μ, σ) The location parameter, μ The scale parameter, σ

For -∞ < t < ∞

Probability density function: f(t) = (1/σ).exp(-(t-μ)/σ -
            exp(-(t-μ)/σ))

Cumulative distribution function: F(t) = exp(-exp(-(t-μ)/σ))

Inverse cumulative distribution function: tp = μ - σ.ln(-ln(p))

Expected value: E(T) = μ + 0.5772.σ

In the following example the element is out of service on average 9%
          of the year and outage events with the location parameter of 6 hours
          and the scale parameter of 1.

Generator, transmission line and gas pipeline planned outages can be
          input with the properties:

However, a complete forecast schedule of maintenance outages is
          rarely available for all plant. The PASA simulation phase can
          automatically schedule additional outages and time those outages and
          time those outages appropriately at times of maximum reserve. Further the maintenance class can be used to perform value-based
          reliability analysis by optimally timing outages accounting for all
          system costs and constraints.
