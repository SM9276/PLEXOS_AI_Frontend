Paragraphs:
Generator Min Stable Level is the
          minimum stable generation level of each generating unit. This minimum
          level is enforced when the unit is turned on i.e. after the
          unit has run up and before it runs down. Specifically the following
          constraint is enforced:

Generation ≥ Units Generating × Min
          Stable Level

Units
            Generating integer

Note that the integrality constraint is relaxed if Unit
            Commitment Optimality is set to "Linear Relaxation" since Units
            Generating in that case is a continuous variable.

For the example in Table 1 each unit will operate between the range
          40-250 when 'on'. When all units are 'on' the minimum is 4 x 40 = 160
          and the maximum 4 x 250 = 1000 for the facility as a whole.

Min Stable Level can be defined as a multi-band property when used in
          conjunction with Generator Head
            Storage Efficiency
            Point to define a different minimum operating level depending on
          the amount of head available at a hydro generator.
