Description:	Storage volume scaling factor used internal to the mathematical program.

Paragraphs:
Fuel Internal Volume Scalar is the
          scaling factor used internally to the mathematical program for Fuel
          storage/stockpile modeling. The default value of one is generally the
          best, unless the stockpile Max
            Inventory is very large in which case increasing the scalar can
          avoid scaling issues in the mathematical programming problem.
