Paragraphs:
The Constraint shadow price is phrased in the context of a primal maximization (benefit maximization) problem, thus a positive value indicates that increasing the right-hand side of a upper limit constraint would increase benefits (or reduce costs). In summary reporting the Price property is the average price across all periods including any zero prices (non-binding) periods. This property in conjunction with Hours Binding is useful in diagnosing problems with generic constraints e.g. generic transmission security constraints.
