Description:	Maximum quantity of gas that can be extracted from the pipeline

Paragraphs:
Max Flow is the maximum quantity of gas that can be extracted from the pipeline in any interval. This includes gas flowing through the pipeline as well as gas taken from storage in the pipeline i.e. it puts an upper limit on the Flow .

Note: De-rating of pipelines in LT is only supported by the Max Flow property. If the user wants to de-rate the pipeline in LT for maintenances and outages per day for example, they would have to use the Max Flow property, whilst setting the interval length to 24 hours.

If you need to set limits over other time frames use the following:
Lists:
