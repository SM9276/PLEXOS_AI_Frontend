Paragraphs:
Generator Max Units Retired is
          the maximum number of units automatically retired in aggregate over
          the planning horizon by LT Plan . The
          cost of retiring a unit is given by Retirement
            Cost . The unit(s) must exist at some time in the planning
          horizon for there to be retirements i.e. you must define either Units (retiring existing units) or Max
            Units Built (building and retiring units in the same run).

Max Units Retired can also be used to retire a stage of a multi-stage
          build as in the following example:

Here the Generator "CCGT Stage 1"
          represents the first stage of CCGT, being two open-cycle gas turbines.
          "CCGT Stage 2" is the second stage when the heat recovery steam
          turbine is added. The two Generator build and retire decisions must be linked logically by Constraints using the coefficients Units
            Built Coefficient , Units
            Retired Coefficient , Units
            Built in Year Coefficient , and Units
            Retired in Year Coefficient as described in the article Capacity
            Expansion Planning .
