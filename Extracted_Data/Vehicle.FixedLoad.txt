Description:	Fixed charging load

Paragraphs:
Vehicle Fixed Load defines a fixed
          profile of charging for an electric vehicle. This property is used
          when the charging profile is known upfront and the travel Demand and battery storage is not being modeled. The load includes charging
          losses (defined by Charge
            Efficiency ) i.e. it is the demand from the Charging
            Station . The load appears at whichever Charging Station the
          Vehicle is attached to at any moment as defined by the Share property.

How the value of Fixed Load is interpreted depends on the Fixed
            Load Global setting. It controls whether the value is across all
          vehicles or per-vehicle.

Note that, when Fixed Load is defined, the electric vehicle's battery
          state-of-charge (Soc) is not modeled and the Demand input is ignored however the distance travelled is computed for the
          purposes of reporting.
