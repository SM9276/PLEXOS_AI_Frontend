Description:	Stochastic optimization method for MT Schedule

Paragraphs:
MT Schedule Stochastic Method sets the algorithm used in MT Schedule to resolve multi-sample data (defined by Variable objects), where the number of samples is set by the Stochastic Stochastic Risk Sample Count . The attribute can take the following values:

When MT Schedule runs in either of the multi-sample modes the decomposition of constraints and other elements performed by the simulation phase yields S solutions and so the corresponding samples in ST Schedule read the decomposition for the appropriate sample. This improves the co-ordination between the simulation phases.
