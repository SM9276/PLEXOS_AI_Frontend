Paragraphs:
The simulator automatically distributes maintenance events
              throughout the simulation horizon during the PASA simulation phase. Maintenance Rate is the fraction of time
              annually that the units are expected to be out-of-service (OOS)
              due to scheduled maintenance events.

Here the Maintenance Rate = 7%, which implies that on average
              units will be out of service (OOS) 0.07 x 8760 = 613 hours per
              annum. The repair time distribution is triangular thus the
              duration of each outage will vary but on average the unit will be
              out of service 7% each year.

Note that:

Different types of maintenance can be modeled on a generator by
              separating the outage types using different band numbers as in the
              example above. In band two there is a 'major survey' of 300 hours
              duration that must be performed once per year: set by the Maintenance
                Frequency . In general however, it's recommended to set the Maintenance Frequency in band 1, this way we do the major survey first, which could
              avoid a situation that after maintenance events scheduled by Maintenance Rate , the
              remaining time space becomes fractional that may not be enough to
              allocate a major maintenance.

Note that defining Units Out and Maintenance Rate in the same band or different two bands will
              result in different maintenance requirements in PASA formulation. Here is an example:



With Units Out and Maintenance Rate defined in
              the same band ( i.e. Scenario "MB1 "),
              the total required maintenance is calculated as:

Maintenance Rate x Capacity x Total
              Hours = 0.08 *500 *8760 = 350400 MWh

This includes discrete maintenance
              (defined by Units Out ) =
              500 * 696 = 348000 MWh and
              distributed Maintenance (the remaining 350400 - 348000) =2400 MWh .

When Units Out and Maintenance Rate are
              defined in different bands ( i.e. Scenario "MB2" ),
              the total required maintenance is calculated as:

Maintenance Rate x Capacity x Total
              Hours + Total Out Capacity = 350400 MWh + 348000 MWh = 698400 MWh

This includes discrete maintenance
              348000 MWh and distributed
              Maintenance 350400 MWh .

Note:

As an output, Maintenance Rate is the percentage of time the unit
              is out-of-service on maintenance either as a result of defining
              Maintenance Rate or Units Out .

	- The total discrete maintenance (as defined by Units
                  Out ) is summed up and subtracted from the distributed
                maintenance requirement (defined by Maintenance Rate).
	- Maintenance events are distributed according to a regional Maintenance Factor set by PASA .
	- The outage duration function used is set by the properties
                described in the article Planned
                  and Random Outages .
	- If Mean Time to
                  Repair is not defined in multi-band case, it will take the
                value from previous band.
	- The PASA phase runs across the
                entire simulation horizon in annual steps. If the horizon is
                less than one year there will be some distortion in the
                placement of distributed maintenance events, since they will not
                be distributed with reference to the entire year. This can be
                controlled to some extent by entering the Maintenance
                  Factor directly.
	- The automatic scheduling of distributed maintenance can be
                switched on/off using the Outage
                  Scope of the Stochastic objects associated with the Model being run. Discrete maintenance events (defined by Units
                  Out ) can only be disabled by either removing the Units
                  Out properties or tagging them with a Scenario and omitting that scenario from the Model being run.
