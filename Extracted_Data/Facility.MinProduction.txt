Paragraphs:
Facility Min Production (and its
          period-specific variants Hour , Day , Week , Month and Year )
          defines a lower bound on the sum of Production in the given time period .

The simulator converts the Production constraints into Constraint objects. By default the constraints are soft - see the Min
            Production Penalty property for details.  The amount of
          violation and the cost are reported as Min
            Production Violation and Min
            Production Violation Cost .
