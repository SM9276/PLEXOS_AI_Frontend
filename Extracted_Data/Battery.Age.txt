Table Details:
Units:	cycles
Mode:	Output Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	
Validation Rule:	
Key Property:	No
Description:	Number of cycles completed
Batt1	Units	1	-
Batt1	Capacity	10	MWh
Batt1	Max Power	1	MW
Batt1	Max SoC	90	%
Batt1	Min SoC	10	%

Paragraphs:
Battery Age is the average age of the Units in cycles.

A complete battery charge and discharge ,
          between the specified Min SoC and Max SoC values, is considered to be a
          full cycle, with the Age based on 'shallow discharging', where the battery can partially
          discharge and then recharge.

Age = ( Generation / Discharge
              Efficiency + Load × Charge
              Efficiency ) × time / ( 2 × ( Max
            SoC - Min SoC ) × Units × Capacity )

The summary value of this property is simply the sum of the interval
          values.

Assuming a battery has been defined as above, and it discharges for
          one hour at a constant 1 MW level with 100% discharge efficiency, then
          the Age would be:

Note that the Capacity used in the age formula is the commissioned unit capacity, i.e. before the effects of any Capacity Degradation .
