Paragraphs:
Commodity Max Injection Change
          creates a Constraint object that
          limits the change in Closing
            Inventory of the Commodity from one month to the next. By
          default this is a 'hard' constraint. To create a soft constraint, set
          the Max Inventory
            Change Penalty property. Note that the change in the first
          period is relative to the Opening
            Inventory .
