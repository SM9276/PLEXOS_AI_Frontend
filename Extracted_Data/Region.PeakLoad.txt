Paragraphs:
Region Peak Load is the maximum input Load over all intervals in the period.

For example, if Partial Chronology maps three intervals with loads 10MW, 20MW and 30MW to a single LDC, the block
            Peak Load is 30MW. In Full Chronology ST Schedule , each interval is modelled directly, so the input Region Load is summed over all bands and reflected in this property.

Note that you can control which periods of time are included in the search for Peak Load with the Peak Period property.
