Paragraphs:
Facility Efficiency Incr is used
          in multi-band pairs with Efficiency
            Point to define a custom efficiency function for the Primary
            Process conducted by the Facility overriding the Process Efficiency .
          The value in band n is the average efficiency between the Efficiency Point n - 1 and n .



For the example in Table 1, the raw data are shown in Table 2. Here
          the input and output energy of the process are used to calculate the
          efficiency at each production level and then the incremental
          efficiency using the formula:

Efficiency Incr n = 100
          Ã— ( Output Energy n - Output Energy ( n -1) ) / (Input Energy n - Input Energy ( n -1) )



The number of bands (tranches) used in the simulation is set by the Max Efficiency Tranches setting. If you want your efficiency function used 'verbatim' then set
          this value equal to the number of bands of input supplied, otherwise
          if you set the value higher or lower than the number of bands supplied
          the efficiency function will be recalculated to match that number of
          bands.

The incremental efficiencies do not need to be monotonic e.g. always increasing or decreasing. By default the function is formulated
          with integer decision variables and constraints that ensure the
          efficiency bands are taken up in order. You can control this with the Formulate Non-convex setting.
