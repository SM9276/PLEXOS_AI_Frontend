Paragraphs:
Flow Storage Injection
          Efficiency is the proportion of injected commodity reaching the
          storage net of any losses.

The example in Table shows properties for a battery energy storage
          system with 95% charge and discharge efficiency. Note that losses are
          reported in the Injection
            Losses and Withdrawal
            Losses output properties.
