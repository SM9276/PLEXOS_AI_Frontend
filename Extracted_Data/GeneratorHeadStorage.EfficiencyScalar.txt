Paragraphs:
Generator Head
            Storage Efficiency Scalar is used to model the effect of 'head'
          on hydro generation efficiency. It is the generation efficiency scalar
          associated with the multi-band Efficiency
            Point . Efficiency Scalar should be defined in multiple bands
          with the highest value in band 1 and monotonically non-increasing
          thereafter as in the following example. The Efficiency Scalar values
          modify the efficiency curve defined by Efficiency
            Base and Efficiency
            Incr . Value less than unity imply that efficiency is reduced,
          values above unity that efficiency is increased.

Example:

Note that the Min Stable
            Level (or Min Stable
            Factor ) may also vary according to the available head.

There are two solution approaches available for modeling head effects
          - see Generator Head
            Effects Method .
