Description:	Monopoly rent from competitive bidding

Paragraphs:
Generator Monopoly Rent is the
          additional profit earned by the Generator due to the selected dynamic Mark-up /strategic
          bidding algorithm, and defined as:

Monopoly Rent = ( Pool
            Revenue - Generation
            Cost ) - ( Shadow Pool
            Revenue - Shadow Generation Cost)

Generally this value would be positive, meaning that strategic
          bidding increased profits, but in some cases it can be negative e.g. if mark-ups are so high that volume is lost.

For Nash-Cournot a negative value can indicate that the simulated
          solution using the inelastic demand function (fixed level of demand)
          does not correspond to the equilibrium found against the linear demand
          curve used in this method.
