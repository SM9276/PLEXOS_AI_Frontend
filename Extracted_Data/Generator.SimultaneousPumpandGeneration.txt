Header: Generator Simultaneous Pump and Generation

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	True (-1)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Key Property:	No
Description:	Pumped storage can pump and generate simultaneously

Paragraphs:
If defined, Generator Simultaneous Pump and Generation overrides the global Production Pump and Generate setting. Simultaneous pumping and generating is allowed or prevented as specified.

If preventing simultaneous pumping and generation, note that linear Unit Commitment Optimality will relax
                the integer restrictions underpinning the prevention. Any unit commitment optimality except linear is therefore recommended when preventing
                simultaneous pumping and generation. Unit commitment optimality can be defined at the Generator or globally via a Production object.
