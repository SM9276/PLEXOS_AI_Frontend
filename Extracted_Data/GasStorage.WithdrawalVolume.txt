Paragraphs:
Gas Storage Withdrawal Volume is Storage volume for which withdrawal is allowed in that given band. Further withdrawals from the storage causing the volume to drop below this value takes the simulation into the next band. The value Withdrawal Volume corresponds with the Withdrawal Rate Scalar value for each band.

When Use Additive Ratchet is Yes, the input is incremental, starting from the last band to the first. Consider the following gas storage withdrawal ratchet:

This defines a 1000 TJ Gas Storage with three withdrawal bands. Band 1 has a volume of 400 TJ and can be withdrawn from at a rate of (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2) * 100 TJ per time period. Band 2 has a volume of 300 TJ and can be withdrawn from at a rate of (0.3 + 0.2) * 100 TJ per time period after band 1 has been depleted. Lastly, band 3 has a volume of 300 TJ and can be withdrawn from at a rate of 0.2 * 100 TJ per time period, after bands 1 and 2 have been depleted.
