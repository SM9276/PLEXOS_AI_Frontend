Header: Gas Plant y

Table Details:
Units:	-
Mode:	Input/Output
Multi-band:	True
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Value to pass-through to solution

Paragraphs:
Gas Plant y is a multi-band value that is passed directly to the solution. The value is not involved in the simulation but is simply a pass-through datum. In summary the value is summed and divided by 1000. Pass-through properties that are attributed to Datafiles follow the slicing methods set in the LT/MT phases.

Pass-through values are useful for benchmarking exercises allowing the convenient comparison of simulated versus actual values.
