Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Capacity Factor Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of Generator Capacity Factor in the 
		  constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

a (i,j) × Generator Capacity Factor ... {≤,
            ≥, =} b j

Note that the Capacity Factor Coefficient should not be paired with any other terms in a constraint.
