Units:	-
Default Value:	1
Validation Rule:	In (0,1,2)
Description:	Level of screen reporting during transmission convergence iterations (none, normal, verbose)

Paragraphs:
Transmission Convergence Report Level controls the level of screen messages are printed during iterations to enforce transmission constraints.  PLEXOS always iterates to enforce transmission limits - so that the very minimum number of such constraints are active in the mathematical program at any time.

This option can take the following values:

By default ("Normal" mode) these iterations report only a single line such as:

If you would like to see details of each limit that is being enforced then set this switch to "Verbose".  A line will then be printed for every limit, showing the current flow level and the limit applied.
