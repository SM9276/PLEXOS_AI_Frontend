Description:	For reliability based sampled chronology ensure sampled periods are contained in contiguous blocks of at least this many hours

Paragraphs:
This MT Schedule option relates
          to the Reliability Chronology feature. This setting applies when PASA is run prior to MT Schedule and
          the Reliability Criterion is used to select sample periods for when Global Sampled Period is input
          directly. Intervals are added if needed to ensure no selected interval
          is contained in a contiguous block of less than this number of hours.
