Description:	Type of cut sharing applied in the SDDP formulation

Paragraphs:
Stochastic SDDP Cut Sharing is an advanced option for the SDDP algorithm.

The Cut Sharing option determines how the Benders cuts, generated
          during the backward pass of the algorithm, are shared between nodes
          (full branches) of the scenario tree. It can take one of the following
          values:
