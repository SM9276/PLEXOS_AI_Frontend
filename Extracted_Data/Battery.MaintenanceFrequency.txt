Paragraphs:
Maintenance Frequency is used to specifically set the number of maintenance events that will occur of the given type each year. This is usually for scheduling large surveys and allows PLEXOS to place the maintenance optimally.

Example:

In this example a major survey of 300 hours must be taken every three years (in 2006 and 2009).
