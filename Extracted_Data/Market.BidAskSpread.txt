Paragraphs:
Market Bid-Ask Spread sets a threshold
          that must be met before trades are economic. The price received in for
          sales into the market is the Price less half the Bid Ask Spread value and the price paid for purchases
          from the market is the Price plus
          half the Bid Ask Spread.

For the example in Table 1, sales into the market receive 35 - 0.5 x 2
          = 34 and purchases are paid at 35 + 0.5 x 2 = 36.
