Description:	Generation capacity that must be scheduled on maintenance

Paragraphs:
Company Min Maintenance sets a lower bound on the generation capacity scheduled on maintenance in the PASA optimization. This constraint only affects the calculation of the optimal profile of Region Maintenance Factor and therefore is not a strict constraint on the actual maintenance timing but more of a guideline.
