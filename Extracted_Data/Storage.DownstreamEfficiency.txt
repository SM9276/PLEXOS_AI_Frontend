Description:	Aggregate efficiency of generation down the river chain

Paragraphs:
Storage Downstream Efficiency
          represents the generation potential of water in storage given the
          efficiency of Exporting
            Generators at this storage plus all those in the cascading
          network after this storage.

For linear cascades the downstream efficiency is computed as:

Downstream Efficiency = ∑ ( 1 / Generator Efficiency )

Downstream Efficiency is used to compute the Initial
            Potential Energy and End
            Potential Energy of water in storage.
