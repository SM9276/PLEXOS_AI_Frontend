Paragraphs:
Generator Hydro Efficiency
          Optimality controls when integers are used to enforce multi-band hydro
          efficiency functions to dispatch in order. The option only applies to
          Generator objects with a Head
            Storage that define Efficiency
            Incr and Load Point in
          multiple bands. The setting can take one of the following values:

Note that this setting is independent to Unit
            Commitment Optimality .
