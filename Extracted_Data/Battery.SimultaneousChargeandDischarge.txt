Header: Battery Simultaneous Charge and Discharge

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	True (-1)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Key Property:	No
Description:	Battery can charge and discharge simultaneously

Paragraphs:
If defined, Battery Simultaneous Charge and Discharge overrides the global Production Pump and Generate setting. Simultaneous charging and discharging is allowed or prevented as specified.

If preventing simultaneous charging and discharging, note that linear Unit Commitment Optimality will relax 
                the integer restrictions underpinning the prevention. Any unit commitment optimality except linear is therefore recommended when preventing
                simultaneous charging and discharging. Unit commitment optimality can be defined at the Battery or globally via a Production object.
