Description:	Maximum number of starts allowed in a week

Paragraphs:
Water Pump Max Starts Day is the maximum number of starts 
          allowed in any week. By default this is a hard constraint, but can be made soft by defining the Max Starts Penalty .

NOTE: If this constraint is intended to be imposed in LT Plan or MT Schedule you must use the chronological version of those phases 
            (see LT Plan Chronology and MT Schedule Chronology ). 
            This rule also applies if you are using one of these phases to decompose the constraint down to ST Schedule .
