# PLEXOS Connect Server

PLEXOS® Connect is the distributed, client-server system to complement the 
PLEXOS® Integrated Energy Model simulation tool. The product enables users to:

* Collaborate in preparing input data for simulations

* Track changes to input data and maintain a version history.

* Distribute simulations for parallel execution over multiple client computers or to the cloud

* Remotely manage distributed simulation jobs

* Easily share, compare and review simulation results

PLEXOS® Connect allows you to control which computers jobs run on, the version 
of input data used, and even the version of the simulation engine. This allows 
you to keep a complete history of inputs, simulation engines and solutions.

To use these scripts, you'll need a licensed, fully configured PLEXOS Connect 
system.
