Paragraphs:
Facility Min Capacity Factor (and
          its period-specific variants ( Hour , Day , Week , Month and Year )
          define a lower bound on a facility' capacity
            factor on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis.

The simulator converts these constraints into Constraint objects. By default the constraints are 'soft' i.e. violation is allowed at a penalty value defined by the Min
            Production Penalty property. To make this a hard constraint set
          that penalty to -1.
