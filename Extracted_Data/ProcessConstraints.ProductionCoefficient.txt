Description:	Coefficient of Process production in the Constraint

Paragraphs:
Process Constraints Production Coefficient sets the coefficient of Production in the Constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × Process Production ... {≤,
