Paragraphs:
LT Plan Sampling Interval applies
          when the Chronology setting is
          "Sampled". Sampling Interval can take the following values:

For example, if Sample Type is
          Day, Sampling Interval is Month, and Samples
            per Sampling Period is 4, there will be 4 days that are selected
          from each month for modeling.

Notice that the value Step is only available for Sample
            Type = Year. In this case, Sampling Interval can only be and
          will be automatically set to Step, regardless the input value of
          Sampling Interval. Also notice that in this case the Overlap can only be zero.
