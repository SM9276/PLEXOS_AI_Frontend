Paragraphs:
This tutorial provides the basic steps required to export data from a PLEXOS database, using the Export Wizard. The first page, figure 1, introduces you to the export wizard, click next to continue.

On the second page, as depicted in figure 2, you have 2 options to configure how much information will be exported:

Additionally, this page allows you to make decisions about the output file.

If you are exporting from a solution, additional options will show on this screen, as shown in figure 2.1, to select the phase and period to export with. These options determine how the export data are sampled, as only one period can be exported at one time. This option will be hidden

If you chose to export selected items only, you will see the page shown in Figure 3. On this page select the items you would like to export.

Note: All items in the export list will be exported

At this point, the export is ready to begin processing. If you have made the correct selections click next to begin the export. While exporting, an export log will be shown on the screen. An example of this can be seen in Figure 5. If you chose to export the data as XML, the exported file will be validated against an XML schema to ensure it is error free. If errors are found, you will see a list of the problems written in red text in the export log. If you get errors during the XML export, there may be errors in your database. These errors should be corrected before re-running the export. XML export files with errors cannot be imported into a database using the import wizard.

Upon successful exports Figure 6 is displayed, and link to the output file is given. Click the link will open the output file in your default text editor To exit the wizard click, Finish.
