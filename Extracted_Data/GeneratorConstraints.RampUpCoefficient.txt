Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Ramp Up Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of Generator Ramp in the upward direction in the
          constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × Generator MAX(0, Ramp ) ... {≤,
            ≥, =} b j
