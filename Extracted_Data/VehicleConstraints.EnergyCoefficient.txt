Key Property:	No
Description:	Coefficient of energy stored in the vehicle

Paragraphs:
Vehicle Constraints Energy Coefficient is the coefficient of energy stored in the Vehicle.

This coefficient adds a term corresponding to the Vehicle end-of-period energy to the left-hand side of the generic constraint equation. Vehicle SoC must be formulated for it
                to be constrained. This property is therefore only valid with detailed Vehicle models (those defining energy storage via properties such as Capacity and Efficiency ). Detailed and simple vehicle models are described in Vehicle .
