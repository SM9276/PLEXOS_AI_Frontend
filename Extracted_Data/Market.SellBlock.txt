Paragraphs:
Market Sell Block defines the period
          over which the option is exercised. Use the default value of 0 to turn
          off the option, or a 1 to indicate the option is available. Quantities
          exercised are even over the period up to the Max Sales. Set the Sell
            Unit property to a value to exercise the option in discrete
          blocks.

Example

In the following example, sales must be made in 5 MW blocks up to a
          limit of 100 MW.

The duration of the block sale can be changed from every interval to
          day, week, month or year using the appropriate period-type version of
          Sell Block.

Example

In the following example, the sale decision is made once per day, and
          if made the 5 MW blocks accepted must be sold in every hour of each
          day.

To use a profiled option over the course of a day, week, month, or
          year; combine the derivative version of Buy Block, and configure Max
          Purchases to represent the pattern. In order to be exercised
          appropriately, the step size in ST Schedule must be set long enough to
          include the option period, and if the discreet option size is used,
          MIP must be selected as this becomes an integer problem. (Note
          selecting rounded relaxation or LP, will not always result in discreet
          block sizes)

Example

In the following example the sale quantity is profiled according to
          the Timeslice objects "HLH" and
          "LLH". This profiling is intra-day, though the block sale decision is
          made once-per-day.
