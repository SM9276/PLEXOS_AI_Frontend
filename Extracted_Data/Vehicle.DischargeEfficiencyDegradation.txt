Description:	Degradation in discharge efficiency with age in number of cycles

Paragraphs:
Vehicle Discharge Efficiency Degradation is the percentage of original nameplate discharge efficiency lost with each battery cycle completed
                (see Vehicle Age ).

The cycles accumulated in each step induce degradation for the following steps (no degradation occurs wihin a single step).
