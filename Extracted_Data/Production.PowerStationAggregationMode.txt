Description:	Automatically create Power Station objects by aggregating Generators

Paragraphs:
This option controls the automatic creation of Power
            Station objects during the data processing phase of the
          simulation. The following options are available:

This auto-aggregation method uses the naming convention of the
          objects to group Generators into a
          collection of Power Station objects. A high-level overview of this process is as follows:

This auto-aggregation method uses the location ( Longitude and Latitude ) of the Nodes to group Generators into a
          collection of Power Station objects. A high-level outline of this process is as follows:
