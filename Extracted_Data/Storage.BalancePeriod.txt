Description:	Frequency of storage balance

Paragraphs:
Storage Balance Period determines
          the frequency with which storage balance constraints are enforced in
          chronological simulation. This setting can take the following values:

Reducing the frequency with which storage is balanced can improve
          simulation time. The trade off is that between balance periods the
          storage bounds are not enforced. For example if you set Balance Period
          = "Day"(1) the storage limits will be enforced only at the end of each
          day. This approximation might be acceptable for long and mid-term
          modelling if the speed up in simulation time is significant e.g. in LT Plan run in chronological mode.
          Another application is in sub-hourly modelling where balancing every
          interval is expensive computationally and not always necessary.
