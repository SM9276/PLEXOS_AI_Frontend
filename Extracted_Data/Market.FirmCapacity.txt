Paragraphs:
Market Firm Capacity is the assumed contribution of the market purchases to 'generation capacity' for capacity reserves calculations in LT Plan . By default the Max Purchases is assumed 'firm' and counted as an 'import' in the Region Net Capacity Interchange . You may override this by setting Firm Capacity directly.

Example

In the following example the Max Purchases is 230 MW, but only 50 MW can be counted as 'firm' for capacity calculations.
