Paragraphs:
Generator Inertia Constant
          represents how much stored energy the generator has per unit of capacity .
          This means the inertia constant represents how long the generator
          could generate at its rated power using only its stored rotational
          kinetic energy, so the inertia constant is measured in units of
          seconds. A 1-GW generator with an inertia constant of 4 seconds could
          deliver 1 GW of power for 4 seconds (or has 4 GW⋅s of stored energy).
          Typical power plants have inertia constants in the range of 2 to 7
          seconds, with hydro plants having the lowest inertia, and gas plants
          having the highest inertia per unit of capacity.

The Inertia Constant must be defined for a generator to provide
          inertia to a Reserve of Type = "Inertia". The generator provides inertia whenever it is operating,
          which includes generating, pumping (for pumped storage) or when
          operating as a synchronous condenser (see Sync
            Cond Units ). The total amount of inertia available is thus equal
          to:

Inertia (MW⋅s) = Inertia Constant (s) ×
          Max Capacity (MW) × ( Units
            Generating + Units Pumping + Units Sync Cond )
