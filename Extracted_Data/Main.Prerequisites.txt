Paragraphs:
The PLEXOS software is designed to run on Windows based PCs. PLEXOS is a highly technical and resource intensive application, and should always be run on the fastest machines possible.

The recommended minimum specification for test machines is:

The recommended minimum specification for x86 architecture production machines is:

*Note that larger problems may require significantly more RAM to achieve optimal performance.

PLEXOS simulations will always benefit from:

PLEXOS is designed to run on Windows operating systems that are currently supported by Microsoft:

The PLEXOS simulation engine requires the Microsoft .NET common language runtime (CLR). The version of the .NET
        framework required depends on the version of PLEXOS being installed:

The appropriate .NET Framework version must be installed on the computer before PLEXOS is installed. The installation
        program will abort if the framework is not installed.

Note that the .NET Framework is automatically installed as part of Windows Update and may already be installed on your
        computer. You can check to see if it has been installed by opening the Add/Remove Programs applet in the Windows Control
        Panel. If the framework is not installed please visit http://www.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/ , or run
        Windows Update from your computer's Start Menu to obtain it. In Windows Update, the .NET Framework is listed under
        updates for your operating system. Once the framework is installed you will be asked to reboot your computer. There may be
        updates available for the .NET Framework and these should be installed before running PLEXOS.

PLEXOS  requires only minimal user privileges:

	- Work-station class machine
	- Dual-core or Quad-core processor
	- 16+ GB RAM*
	- DirectX 9.0C level graphics or newer
	- Faster processors (higher clock speed is more benefit than more cores/CPU)
	- Faster memory e.g., RDRAM rather than SDRAM
	- Faster disks e.g., SCSI or SATA rather than IDE or UIDE
	- Windows 11
	- Windows 10
	- Windows Server 2022
	- Windows Server 2019
	- Windows Server 2016
	- PLEXOS 8.0/8.1 requires .NET Framework 4.6.1
	- PLEXOS 8.2/8.3 requires .NET Framework 4.7.2
	- PLEXOS 9.0 and all minor versions require .NET 5.0
	- All versions of PLEXOS 9.1 and 9.2 require .NET 6.0
