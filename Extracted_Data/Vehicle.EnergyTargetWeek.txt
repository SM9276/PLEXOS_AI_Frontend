Description:	End of week vehicle stored energy target

Paragraphs:
Vehicle Energy Target Week is the end of week stored energy target. Energy Target Week adds a constraint on the Vehicle's energy level at the end of each week.

Vehicle SoC must be formulated for it
                to be constrained. This property is therefore only valid with detailed Vehicle models (those defining energy storage properties such as Capacity and Efficiency ). Detailed and simple vehicle models are described in Vehicle .
