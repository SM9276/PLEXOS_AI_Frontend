Header: Transmission LODF Threshold

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0.03
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Description:	Minimum absolute value of LODF to be used in contingency flow constraints.

Paragraphs:
This is the minimum absolute threshold for Line Outage Distribution Factors that are used in contingency flow constraints. Any calculated LODF whose absolute value
                    is less than this tolerance will be set to 0 for purposes of calculating and constraining the post-contingent flow.
