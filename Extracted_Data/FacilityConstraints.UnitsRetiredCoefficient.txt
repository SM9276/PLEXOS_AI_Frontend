Description:	Coefficient of number of units retired

Paragraphs:
Facility Constraints Units Retired Coefficient is the left-had side coefficient of the
          number of Units Retired in
          the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × ∑ ( t = 1, k ) ( Facility Units
            Retired t ) ... {≤,
            ≥, =} b j

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation
