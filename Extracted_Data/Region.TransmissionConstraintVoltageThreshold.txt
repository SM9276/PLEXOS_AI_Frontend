Header: Region Transmission Constraint Voltage Threshold

Table Details:
Units:	kV
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Key Property:	No
Description:	Voltage level at which thermal limits are modeled in this region.

Paragraphs:
Region Transmission Constraint Voltage Threshold is the voltage level at which thermal limits are modelled in this region.

Region Constraint Voltage Threshold sets the voltage level at which line and transformer (branch) thermal limits are enforced. 
          This relies on the node voltages being defined a priori . 
          This setting works in conjunction with the general Transmission Constraint Voltage Threshold . 
          The value used for the region will be the maximum of the regional and the global value. 
          To control the threshold uniquely on the region, set the global value to 0 and populate this property to the desired value for all regions.
