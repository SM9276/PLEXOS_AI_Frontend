Paragraphs:
Generator Max Heat Rate Tranches
          is the maximum number of tranches in the piecewise linear
          approximation to the fuel function defined by the Heat
            Rate Model . This property overrides the Production Max Heat Rate
            Tranches setting for the executing Model .
