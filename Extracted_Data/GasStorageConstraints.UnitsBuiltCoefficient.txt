Paragraphs:
Gas Storage Constraints Units Built Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient in the
          constraint of the binary (0,1) variable indicating if the Gas
            Storage is built to date.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation.
