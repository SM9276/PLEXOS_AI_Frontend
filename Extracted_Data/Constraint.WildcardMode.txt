Paragraphs:
Constraint Wildcard Mode is Controls whether or not the Constraint is copied when it is associated with a wildcard membership.

Constraints are not copied to each new object, instead a single constraint is split across the new objects. E.g. If we have a generation coefficient = 100MW on one generator and four new copies are made, the sum total of generation for the new generators will be 100MW

Whether a constraint is copied or split is decided internally, the decision is based on what other objects are attached to the constraint.

Copy regardless of other memberships. Using our example above, when this property is set to Copy, the four new generators will each have a generation coefficient constraint = 100MW
