Input

Process Capacity is the maximum
          production capacity measured in units of the primary
            output . This input is optional. By default the Process has
          infinite capacity when 'floating' i.e. not linked to any Facility . When linked, it is limited
          by the Facility Max
            Operating Level .

Output

Process Capacity as an output reports
          the minimum of the input Capacity and the production capacity of Facility objects implementing the Process.
