Header: LT Plan Sample Year Count

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Description:	For [Chronology] = "Sampled", first select this many years then sample within only those years.

Paragraphs:
For Chronology = "Sampled", when
          this Sample Year Count is set, Sample
            Reduction Algorithm will be invoked firstly select this many
          years then sample within only those years statistically. Another
          option is to enter a list of sample years manually via Globals Sampled Year .

Please note these two options only work with Sampled Chronology in LT Plan , and the simulation runs in one single step for the whole horizon. This means using Fitted/Partial Chronology or Rolling
              Horizon solution method would result in the sample year settings being ignored.
