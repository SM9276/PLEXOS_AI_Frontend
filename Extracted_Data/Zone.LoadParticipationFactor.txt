Paragraphs:
Zone Load Participation Factor is the
          proportion of load that occurs in the zone. The application of this
          property depends on where the load property is defined:

If you define Region Load then the Nodes in the Zone will calculate Load as:

Load = Region Load × Region Load Scalar × Load Participation
          Factor × Node Load
            Participation Factor

Otherwise if you define Zone Load then the Nodes in the Zone will calculate Load as:

Load = Zone Load × Zone Load Scalar × Load Participation
          Factor × Node Load
            Participation Factor
