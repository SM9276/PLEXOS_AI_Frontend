Description:	Method for solving optimal power flow.

Paragraphs:
Transmission OPF Method sets the type of formulation used to model Optimal Power Flow . It can take these values:

The two methods provide broadly similar capabilities, with the variable shift factor being a more verbose formulation similar to the formulations used in these LMP-based markets:

The fixed-shift factor method is a more traditional linearized DC OPF suitable for modelling large networks.

These methods are discussed in detail in the article OPF Methods .

Both methods support modelling of transmission losses.
