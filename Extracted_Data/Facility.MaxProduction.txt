Paragraphs:
Facility Max
            Production (and its period-specific variants Hour , Day , Week , Month and Year )
          define an upper bound on the sum of Facility Production in the given time period.

A straight-forward approach to modelling a production-constrained
          facility ( e.g. a hydro generator) is to place periodic limits
          on the Facility's production as in Table 1.

Note the use Max
            Production Month variant and time
            slices (patterns) to change the Production limits by each month
          of the year.

The simulator converts the Production constraints into Constraint objects. By default the constraints are hard i.e. no
          violation is allowed. If you prefer to allow violations then use the Max Production Penalty property.
