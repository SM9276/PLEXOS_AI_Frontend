Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Price for violating non-anticipativity constraints in scenario-wise decomposition mode

Paragraphs:
Generator Pump Load Non-anticipativity applies when the phase Stochastic Method is set to "Scenario-wise Decomposition". It is used to identify the non-anticipative Pump Load decisions, and must be set in combination with Pump Load Non-anticipativity Time .
