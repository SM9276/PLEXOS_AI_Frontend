Header: Diagnostic Region Supply

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	Execute region supply diagnostic (this is an active diagnostic)

Paragraphs:
The Region Supply Diagnostic is a tool for determining, in each interval of the simulation, and for the selected Region the total supply capacity from Generators and Imports . The diagnostic runs each simulation step after the normal simulation iterations are complete and produces a report in XML format. The method is as follows:

The calculated supply capacity is the maximum amount of supply that can be delivered to the Region taking into account all active transmission and generation constraints.

NOTE: The source code for this Diagnostic is included in the OpenPLEXOS project and distributed with the installation files.
