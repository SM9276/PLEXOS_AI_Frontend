Description:	If the forward pass samples in SDDP should be replaced by user-defined samples

Paragraphs:
Stochastic SDDP Replace Samples is an advanced option for the SDDP algorithm.

When enabled, the forward pass samples generated for the scenario
          tree are replaced with user-defined samples. These user-defined
          samples are provided as Variable objects with names that match the original Variable object's providing the inflow samples but with "_FWD" appended to the
          name. For example, if you have Storage Natural Inflow defined with a Variable called "Big Lake" then the
          corresponding forward pass samples would be defined by a Variable named "Big Lake_FWD". That Variable should have Sampling Method = "User" and the Profile band count should match the number of full branches ( Global Tree Stages Leaves ).
