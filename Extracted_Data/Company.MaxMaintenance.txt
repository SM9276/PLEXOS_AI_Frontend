Description:	Maximum generation capacity allowed to be scheduled on maintenance

Paragraphs:
Company Max Maintenance puts a cap on the amount of generation capacity scheduled on maintenance in the PASA optimization. This constraint only affects the calculation of the optimal profile of Region Maintenance Factor and therefore is not a strict constraint on the actual maintenance timing but more of a guideline.
