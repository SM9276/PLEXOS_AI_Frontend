Paragraphs:
Battery Nodes Distribution Factor is the proportion of battery charge and discharge at the node. This property enables the charging and discharging of a battery to be split across multiple nodes. The charging and discharging of a battery is proportioned symmetrically. For example, a distribution factor of 0.5 at a node implies that half of the charging and half of the discharging absorbs/injects through that node. Distribution factor can be used to model a battery object which connects to multiple different locations.

All distribution factors for a battery object should sum to 1 to reflect the conservation of energy.
