Description:	Maximum number of hours a battery can have zero discharge after discharging stops

Paragraphs:
Battery Max Down Time is the maximum number of hours a battery can have zero discharge after discharging stops. It is based only on discharging, not charging.
                Max Down Time is a static property. If it is defined dynamically (varying according to different periods), the maximum value will be used.

Note: It is recommended to set the Min Discharge Level to a value greater than 0 when this property is used.
