Description:	Secondary input consumption as a proportion of primary input consumption

Paragraphs:
Process Secondary
            Inputs Ratio is the secondary input consumption as a proportion
          of either the Primary Input Consumption or the Primary Output Production .
          Which denominator is applied depends on the Denominator property.

For example:
Lists:
	- In water desalination the Primary
              Input could be a Commodity called "Seawater" measured in the Unit m 3 with secondary input of a Commodity "Electricity" measured in the Unit kWh. If each 1 m 3 of "Seawater" is combined with 3 kWh of
            "Electricity" in the Process then you would set the Ratio for
            "Electricity" to 3 and Denominator = "Input".
	- In electrolysis, the Primary
              Input could be a Commodity called "Electricity" measured in the Unit kWh with secondary input of "H 2 O" measured in the Unit kL with primary output being "H 2 " measured in the Unit kg. If each kg of output "H 2 " requires 10 kL of "H 2 O" you would set
            Ratio for "H 2 O" to 10 and Denominator = "Output".
