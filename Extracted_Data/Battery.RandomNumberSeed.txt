Key Property:	No
Description:	Random number seed assigned to the generator for the generation of outages

Paragraphs:
Setting Battery Random Number Seed to a value other than zero allows you to control the sequence of random numbers used to create generator distributed maintenance and forced outage events. This seed overrides the Random Number Seed defined on the Model .

Note that you can capture the seeds generated from another simulation with the Diagnostic Random Number Seed .

This option can be useful if you want to ensure that a sequence of outages is repeated regardless of other changes in the data input, since by default the seeding of batteries can change when new Battery objects are added to the system.
