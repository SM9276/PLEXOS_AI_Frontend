Header: Line Reactance

Table Details:
Units:	pu
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Together with any resistance this makes up the lines impedance
A-B	Reactance	0.05	p.u.
A-B	Resistance	0.02	p.u.

Paragraphs:
Line Reactance is used in combination with Resistance to define line impedance.

Example

Note that reactance is converted to susceptance using the formula g = 1 / x. If it is more convenient, the susceptance value can be specified directly using the Susceptance property and the reactance can be omitted.
