Paragraphs:
Constraint RHS Custom defines the right-hand side (constant) for the constraint. Setting this property results in the set up of one constraint that will apply over the entire planning horizon. The inclusion/exclusion of periods in the constraint is controlled using the left-hand side coefficients alone. Thus this type of constraint can be used to model multi-annual constraints as well as constraint over any custom period of time that does not fit with the 'standard' interval/day/week/month/year constraint versions.

Example:

The following example defines a constraint on the fuel offtake of a generator that applies over a specific period of time; in this case a 'gas year' that is different to the calendar year.

NOTE: In most cases for RHS Day/Week/Month/Year/Custom, the RHS scalar is 1000. However, there are some exceptions where the RHS scalar is 1. The exceptions include all non-quantity constraints, 
    all gas constraints, Maintenance Min Occurrence constraints, constraints related to Storages (with End Volume/End Level/Ramp Coefficient) / Waterways (with Ramp Coefficient) / Maintenances 
    (with Start Hour Coefficient) / Generators (with Capacity Factor Coefficient or only defined interval Units Started/Units Shutdown/Units Generating/Operating Hours/Pump Operating Hours Coefficient), 
    constraints using expansion, and constraints not using activities.
