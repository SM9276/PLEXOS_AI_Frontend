Description:	Random number seed for this model

Paragraphs:
Model Random Number Seed is the seed used to create random numbers for the simulation such as Generator Forced Outage and sampling of Variables . The default value of zero means this seed is regenerated every time the Model is run.

To repeat results of a previous run set the seed to a number other zero.

Note that the log file of the simulation reports the seed (generated or input) so that you can input that seed again to repeat the results.

Individual elements can also have their seeds set so that outages and/or sample values are repeatable even if the number of elements in the database changes:
