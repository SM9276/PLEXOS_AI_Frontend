Paragraphs:
Vehicle Discharging is the output
          from the vehicle operating in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode. This value
          is output as seen by the Charging
            Station . The load drawn from the battery includes additional
          losses implied by the Discharge
            Efficiency . For example, if the battery output is 2 kW and
          Discharge Efficiency is 65% then Discharging will report 1.3 kW while
          the battery will lose 2 kWh of energy in an hour.
