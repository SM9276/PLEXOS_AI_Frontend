Paragraphs:
Storage End Potential Energy is the
          potential energy of the End Volume and is calculated as:

End Potential Energy = End
            Volume × Downstream Efficiency × time

For example, using the metric volume Model :

Therefore the time conversion is GWh = Downstream
            Efficiency × 86400 / (3600 × 1000) = Downstream
            Efficiency × 0.024 i.e.

End Potential Energy = End
            Volume × Downstream
            Efficiency × 0.024

In a cascading hydro river model the potential energy is summed
          downstream so the total potential energy declines as you traverse down
          the river chain.
