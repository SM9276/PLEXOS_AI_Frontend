Header: Performance Small LP Nonzero Count

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	250000
Validation Rule:	>0
Description:	Maximum number of non-zeros in a 'small' linear programming problem.

Paragraphs:
Problems with this number of non-zeros or less are considered 'small' and will always use the solver algorithm set by the Small LP Optimizer . Problems with more non-zeros are considered 'large' and use the optimizers set by the Cold Start Optimizer 1 , Cold Start Optimizer 2 , Cold Start Optimizer 3 , Hot Start Optimizer 1 , etc .
