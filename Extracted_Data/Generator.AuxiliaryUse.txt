Paragraphs:
Generator Auxiliary Use is the total of all station auxiliary loads (in-house use):

The auxiliary use is set by the inputs Aux Incr , Aux Base , and Aux Fixed .  These can be used in any combination.

Example:

Here there is a constant station load of 0.5 MW per installed unit. Each unit that is running incurs a load of 3 MW and loses 3% of its raw generation to auxiliaries. Thus with one unit generating at total of 250 MW the power station consumes 0.5 x 2 + 3 x 1 + 0.03 x 250 = 11.5 MW. The sent out generation is 250 - 11.5 = 238.5 MW.

Note that if you do not define auxiliary losses then generator heat rate functions must be entered on a sent-out basis.

How auxiliary loads affect the load and hence the dispatch is controlled by the setting Region Load Metering Point . By default auxiliary loads are assumed to be captured in the input load and thus are only calculated after the dispatch.
