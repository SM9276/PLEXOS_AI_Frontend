Paragraphs:
Storage Max Ramp is the maximum allowed rate of change ( Ramp ) in storage End Volume between one dispatch interval and the next. The volume is allowed to change up or down by this amount at most. By default the constraint is a hard constraint meaning that no violations are allowed. Violations can be allowed by defining the penalty price using the Max Ramp Penalty property.

The Ramp can also be constrained over longer time periods using the Max Ramp Hour , Max Ramp Day , Max Ramp Week , Max Ramp Month , Max Ramp Year properties.

The Ramp can also be constrained using the Constraint Storages Ramp Coefficient property. This allows you to create a soft constraint with a multi-band penalty price. It also allows you to limit the ramp across any custom period of time using the RHS Custom type.

Example:

The actual ramp is reported as the Ramp property and the shadow price of the ramping constraint is reported as Ramp Price .
