Paragraphs:
Facility Min Units Built in Year
          sets a lower bound on the number of units built by LT
            Plan in any single year of the planning horizon. It is generally
          used to force the building a particular option out of a multi-unit
          facility as in the following example:

Note that Min Units Built in Year must be compatible with Max
            Units Built i.e. there must be enough units allowed to
          be built to meet this constraint. In the above example it is allowed
          to build up to three units in the planning horizon, but one must be
          built in year 2025.
