Header: Performance MIP Relative Gap

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0.0001
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Description:	Declare the integer solution optimal when this gap is reached between the current integer solution and best-bound linear relaxation (this is not a measure of optimality).

Paragraphs:
Performance MIP Relative Gap is a
          solver setting for the mixed integer optimizer. The parameter may take
          any value in the range 0.0 to 1.0.

When the value:

|bestbound-bestinteger|/(1e-10+|bestinteger|)

falls below the value of this parameter, the mixed integer
          optimization is stopped.

Here:



For unit commitment/economic dispatch problems a relative gap of
          between 0.1-1% can provide a good balance of quality and performance.

Lists:
	- 'bestinteger' refers to the objective function value associated
            with the best integer feasible solution found so far; and
	- 'bestbound' refers to the objective function value of any linear
            relaxation to the integer problem that has yet to be 'ruled out' as
            potentially leading to a better integer solution
