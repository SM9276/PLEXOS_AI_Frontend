Paragraphs:
Facility Ramp is the change in
          output in the period and is defined as:

Ramp t = Production t - Production ( t - 1)

where: t indexes periods of the
            simulation. The t =0 value of Production refers to the
            previous simulation step and for step one it is set with the Initial
              Production property.

Limits on ramping are defined with the Max
            Ramp Up and Max Ramp Down properties.
