Table Details:
Description:	Gas processing plant e.g. converting raw natural gas to pipeline quality

Paragraphs:
See also Gas Plant Property Reference for a
          detailed list of properties for this class of object.

A Gas Plant connects two parts of the gas network via the Input Node and Output Node memberships.

See the Gas Modelling article
          for details.

Natural gas plant is the unit that purifies raw natural gas extracted
          from a well. The Obligatory membership for this object is the " Gas Plant Output Node " which highlights in which " Gas Node " the "Gas Plant" exports gas. Gas plants can also be linked to
          electric Nodes.

" Gas Field " can be activated or
          deactivated from the system with the use of " Units " property. If the user wants to remove it, then the value of zero
          should be set. The Max. and Min. production of gas can be limited
          using the " Max Production "
          and " Min Production "
          properties respectively, while the consumption of the plant can be set
          as well.

The maximum units of "Gas Plants" to be built through the Horizon can
          be constrained from the " Max Units Built " property, while the maximum built number per year can be adjusted
          by the " Max Unit Built in Year " property. The same stands for the maximum number of retirement gas
          plat units per year " Max Units Retired in year " or in total within our simulation " Max Units Retired ".
