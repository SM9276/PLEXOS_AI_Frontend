Description:	Coefficient of number of units built

Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Units Built Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of the
          number of Units Built from
          the start of the horizon up to the current period in the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × ∑ ( t = 1, k ) ( Generator Units Built t ) ... {≤, ≥, =} b j

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation
