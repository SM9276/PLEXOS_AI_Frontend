Paragraphs:
Market Min Purchases Hour creates a Constraint object that sets a lower
          bound on the Purchases from the
          Market each hour. By default this is a 'hard' constraint. This
          property only applies to sub-hourly simulations i.e. where Horizon Periods per Day is greater
          than 24.
