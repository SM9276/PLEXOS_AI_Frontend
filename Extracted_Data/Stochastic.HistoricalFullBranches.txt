Header: Stochastic Historical Full Branches

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	Flag if full branches should be mapped by historical data in the PARMA model

Paragraphs:
This option applies when the PARMA
            Model Type is set to "PARMA". When set to true, the full
          branches of the scenario tree are generated from historical data (see Data Fie Historical
            Sampling ) rather than sampling using PARMA.
