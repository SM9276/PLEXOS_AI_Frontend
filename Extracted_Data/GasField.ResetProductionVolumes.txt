Header: Gas Field Reset Production Volumes

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Key Property:	No
Description:	If the production volumes should be reset in the current period.

Paragraphs:
Gas Field Reset Production Volumes allows the cumulative production volume totals, which are used in conjunction with 
          multi-band Production Cost and Production Volume values, to be 
          reset at specified periods. By default, the production in each band is cumulated across the study horizon such that 
          once one band is used up it cannot be used in subsequent periods. But if this input is set to Yes for a given period, the totals for each band are reset to 0 and 
          the field will start again producing from the first band.    Note that using this input will not change how the total volume in the Gas Field is tracked across the 
          simulation.
