Paragraphs:
Region Constraints Generation Capacity Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of
          the total Region Generators Firm Capacity in the
          constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation.
