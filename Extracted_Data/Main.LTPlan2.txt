Header: LT Plan - Problem Size

Table Details:

Paragraphs:










The capacity 'sub-problem' of the LT Plan formulation uses annual
          build/retire decisions. Thus the number of these elements in the
          formulation is relatively small. No problem size reduction is required
          to these elements. However, if all decisions are integer (as
          controlled by the LT Plan Optimality option), then the problem can become very hard to solve. You can
          reduce the number of integers by selectively turning off integer
          optimization at the Generator level
          using the Generator Expansion
            Optimality property. You can also specify the integerization
          horizon using the LT Plan Integerization
            Horizon attribute. For example in a 30-year study you can choose
          to integerize only the first 10 years, leaving decisions beyond 10
          years linear.





LT Plan by default spans the whole simulation planning horizon in a
          single optimization 'step'. For realistically-sized power systems and
          long planning horizons this may lead to extremely big problems in the
          production cost 'sub-problem'. To make this problem tractable, two
          problem size reduction techniques can be used:

The key controlling parameters for the Chronology options are:

The equivalent parameters are described in detail in the MT
            Schedule article.

The level of detail used to model Generator heat rates can have a significant effect on the size and difficulty of
          the LT Plan formulation. The setting LT Plan Heat
            Rate Detail by default uses the "Simplest" possible form in
          order to reduce problem size.
