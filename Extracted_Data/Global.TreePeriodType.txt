Paragraphs:
Global Tree Period Type sets the
          period type for the Tree
            Stages Position argument. The setting can take these values:

Example

In the following, a three-stage tree is defined where the first stage
          ends at week 3, the second at 4.

Notice that the Tree Period Type will affect the sample values. If
          this parameter is not set to Interval, the samples will be averaged in
          the provided Tree Period Type. When using Global Tree Stages Hanging Branches , only the weekly and monthly Tree Period Type are supported. Additionally,
		  monthly tree is incompatible when ST phase is enabled, as the monthly stage future cost function derived from the prior phase will not align with any ST step type.
