Paragraphs:
Fuel Unit sets the unit that applies to
          the input properties such as Price , Max Offtake , etc.

If the Fuel Unit is not set ,
          the default unit is read from the settings in the Units of Data page
          of the Settings menu available from the ribbon in the GUI. The default
          units are:

If Fuel Unit is set, you may select any
          one of a wide range of supported units. Refer to Commodity Unit for a list of units. Note that
          only a subset are relevant for Fuel Unit.

Unit works with Energy Density to determine the heat value of the fuel for use in the simulation.

Example





In this example:
Lists:
	- "Biomass" inputs are in kilograms (kg) and the energy density is
            16 MJ/kg and the price is $0.5/kg
	- "Coal" inputs are in tonnes (t) and the energy density is 24,000
            MJ/t (24 MJ/kg) and the price is $150/t
	- "Gas" inputs are in the default unit (GJ for metric) and Energy
            Density is not required to be input (it is 1000 MJ/GJ) and the price
            is $8/GJ
	- "Oil" inputs are in bbl (barrels of oil) which has a default
            energy density of 6118 MJ/bbl and the price is $80/bbl
