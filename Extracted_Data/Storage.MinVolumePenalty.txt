Description:	Penalty for violatiog the Min Volume constraint

Paragraphs:
Storage Min Volume Penalty is the
          penalty for violating the Min Volume constraint. The default value of -1 means the constraint is 'hard' and
          cannot be violated. A value of zero relaxes the constraint and any
          positive values allows violation at a cost. Note that the constraint
          is only allowed to be relaxed to zero i.e. negative storage
          values are not allowed. The violation penalty is expressed in energy
          terms ($/MWh), therefore if your Storage Model is not "Energy" you should
          define Downstream
            Efficiency so the penalty can be interpreted in terms of volume
          of water in the optimization.

Violations and cost are reported in the properties Min
            Volume Violation and Min
            Volume Violation Cost .
