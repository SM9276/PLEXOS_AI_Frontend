Header: Performance Carry over MIP Time

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	If unused MIP Max Time is carried over to the next MIP solve allowing more time on harder problems

Paragraphs:
Performance Carry over MIP Time toggles on/off the carry over of any
          spare time allowance between mixed integer programming (MIP)
          solves.  This applies only when MIP
            Max Time is set. When a MIP is solved the solver will be given a
          time limit according to that setting.  If the solver completes
          inside the time limit the 'surplus' time is recorded. If Carry over
          MIP Time is 'on' this surplus time  will be added to the time
          limit allowed for the next MIP solve. Setting this will allow more
          time to be spent on harder problems and may improve the overall
          solution produced, at the cost of a longer overall run time.

Note that the total time allowed including carry over can be limited
          with the MIP Max
            Time with Carry over setting.
