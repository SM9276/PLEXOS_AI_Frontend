Paragraphs:
Line Loss is the sum of losses incurred for Flow in both forward and reverse directions.

When losses are defined by Resistance the reported Loss is based on the equation:

Please notice that if the OPF method is set to \it \small "Fixed \ Shift \ Factor" then the calculated loss is multiplied by a Loss Refactor (LR)
parameter which is calculated as follows:

However, if a piecewise linear loss model is used, the loss is reported as the sum of losses in the active flow segments.

Other loss models can be defined using these parameters:

The loss on the line is allocated to the connected Nodes as defined by the Loss Allocation property.
