Header: Transmission SCUC Constraint Voltage Threshold

Table Details:
Units:	kV
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Description:	Voltage level at which SCUC line thermal limits are modelled.

Paragraphs:
Transmission SCUC Constraint Voltage Threshold sets the voltage level for transmission Lines and Transformers whose post-contingency flows should be monitored and enforced within limits in the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) algorithm as described in the article Security Constrained Unit Commitment .  Elements with voltage below this level will not have their limits enforced if the SCUC calculates that they would be violated during any contingency .  This parameter allows you to reduce the number of limits enforced by SCUC and so improve performance.
