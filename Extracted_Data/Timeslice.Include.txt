Paragraphs:
Timeslice Include sets which time periods are included in the Timeslice definition. Use the Date From , Date To , or Pattern fields for "simple" definitions or read the values from a text file, using the Data File field for more complex definitions.

Example

Note that the default value of Include of zero means "do not include" the period, thus you must use a non-zero value e.g. -1 to define which periods are included in the Timeslice .
