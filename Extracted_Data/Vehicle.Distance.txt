Paragraphs:
Vehicle Distance is the distance
          travelled by the vehicle. If Fixed Load is defined, then the
          distance is calculated as follows:

Distance = Units x 1000 x Fixed Load / Efficiency

Otherwise, if Demand is defined then it is calculated as follows:

Distance = Units x Demand x Interval Length (in Hours).
