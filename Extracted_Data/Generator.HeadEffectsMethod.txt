Paragraphs:
Generator Head Effects Method
          controls how the formulation accounts for the effects of storage head
          on hydro generator efficiency.

This setting can take the following values:

The efficiency of hydro generation is set each simulation step
              based on the Storage Initial
                Volume . Efficiency does not change inside the step, so this
              method works well if the storage is large enough. This method is
              the fastest because it does not require the formulation of the
              head to efficiency relationship directly in the optimization. Note
              that this is the only method available when using the Stochastic
                Algorithm = "SDDP". In this case the generator efficiency is
              updated at each stage of the scenario tree in each iteration.

The head to efficiency relationship is formulated inside the
              optimization problem and efficiency will change dynamically. This
              approach is the most accurate but is expensive in terms of
              simulation time.
