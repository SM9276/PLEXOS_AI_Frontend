Paragraphs:
Generator Max Units Built in Year
          sets an upper limit on the number of new units that LT
            Plan is allowed to build in any single year of the planning
          horizon. This property should be used in combination with Max
            Units Built and offers a finer control over the timing of new
          builds.

In this example at most one new unit can be built in the planning
          horizon, but the new build cannot occur until after 1/01/2020 and also
          cannot happen in the year 2025.
