Paragraphs:
Interface Flow, in reporting by interval, is the net flow on the interface, or:

This sum shows both net and directed Line Flow terms. In practice, the interface would use just one set of Line flow coefficients.

In reporting summary values (day, week, etc ), Flow is defined as the sum of flows in the reference direction and Flow Back is the total flow in the counter-reference direction,
