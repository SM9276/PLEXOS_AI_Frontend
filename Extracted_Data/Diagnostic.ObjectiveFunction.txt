          produces a tab-delimited text diagnostic file that lists all variables
          that appear in the objective function with a non-zero coefficient and
          non-zero optimal value along with any objective function constant. It
          then lists the activity of those variables, such that you can compute
          term-by-term the elements that make up the complete objective function
          value.
