Paragraphs:
Region VoLL is the value of lost load or shortage cost when the system has Unserved Energy , which occurs when the Load exceeds the Generation .

Example

Note that in order to prevent unserved energy being chosen as an economic option ahead of generation the simulator uses a different value of VoLL internally. This is controlled by the Transmission Internal VoLL property.
