Paragraphs:
PASA Compute Reliability Indices
          toggles on/off the algorithm that computes the following reliability
          indices:

These indices are computed using a convolution approach described in
          the LOLP topic.

The resulting periods of non-zero LOLP can be used to select the
          sampled intervals for detailed simulation in MT
            Schedule - see Chronology .
