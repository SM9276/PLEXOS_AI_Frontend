Description:	Coefficient of number of units built in the year

Paragraphs:
Commodity Constraints Units Built in Year Coefficient is Coefficient of number of units
          built in the year.

Commodity Constraints Units Built Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of the
          number of Units Built in
            the year in the constraint.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × Commodity Units Built t ... {≤, ≥, =} b j

where: t is the current period e.g. year of the simulation
