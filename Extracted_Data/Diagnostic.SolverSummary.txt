Paragraphs:
Diagnostic Solver Summary controls the printing of a brief summary of each solution to the mathematical programming problems solved during the simulation. These summaries are of the following format depending on the LP/MIP solved:

For Linear problems, the output is as follows:

For Integer problems, the output is as follows:

Condition numbers are further described in Numerical Stability .

The solver status depends on the solver used in the optimization. The table below presents the status codes, descriptions, and the solver status output generated by PLEXOS for Gurobi.
