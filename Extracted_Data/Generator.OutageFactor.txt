Paragraphs:
Generator Outage Factor sets the Outage Rating of each unit
          during the associated Forced or Maintenance outage as a
          proportion of the Max Capacity .

In this example the outage factor is 90%, and so the implied Outage
            Rating is 10 i.e. (1 - Outage Factor) x Rating .

Note that Outage Factor overrides Outage
            Rating if both are defined.
