Description:	Method used to decompose constraints between LT Plan/MT Schedule and MT Schedule/ST Schedule

Paragraphs:
Constraint Decomposition Method controls the formulation used in the 'lower' simulation phase MT Schedule / ST Schedule for constraints that are decomposed by the 'higher' phases LT Plan / MT Schedule . This option can take the following values:

The latter option allows some flex in the decomposed constraints, but may result in slight violation or under-use of the constraint.
