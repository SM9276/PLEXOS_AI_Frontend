Table Details:
Units:	-
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Right hand side each month (000)

Paragraphs:
Constraint RHS Month defines the right-hand side (constant) term for each month of the planning horizon. Setting this property defines the period of the constraint as one constraint per month.

NOTE: In most cases for RHS Day/Week/Month/Year/Custom, the RHS scalar is 1000. However, there are some exceptions where the RHS scalar is 1. The exceptions include all non-quantity constraints, 
    all gas constraints, Maintenance Min Occurrence constraints, constraints related to Storages (with End Volume/End Level/Ramp Coefficient) / Waterways (with Ramp Coefficient) / Maintenances 
    (with Start Hour Coefficient) / Generators (with Capacity Factor Coefficient or only defined interval Units Started/Units Shutdown/Units Generating/Operating Hours/Pump Operating Hours Coefficient), 
    constraints using expansion, and constraints not using activities.
