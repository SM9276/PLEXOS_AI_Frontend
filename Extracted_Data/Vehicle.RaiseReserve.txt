Paragraphs:
Vehicle Raise Reserve is the
          provision of raise ('spin up') reserve summed over all raise reserve types (raise, regulation raise and
          operational). Raise reserve is provided by reserving some Discharging capability from the battery when the SoC is above Min SoC . or by offering to
          reduce Charging of the battery.
          This is allowed only when the Vehicle is connected to Charging
          Stations providing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services i.e. when
          Charging Station Max
            Discharge Rate is non-zero.
