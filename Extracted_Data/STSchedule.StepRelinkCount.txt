Header: ST Schedule Step Relink Count

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	1
Validation Rule:	≥1
Description:	Number of steps that require relinking of initial conditions in parallel Step Link Mode, where 1 means no relinking

Paragraphs:
ST Schedule Step Relink Count
          applies when Step Link Mode = "Parallel".  "Relinking" refers to running an additional pass
          of selected simulation steps taking into account the initial
          conditions from the previous step. The steps within in each Sequential
            Steps block are already linked together by end conditions (of
          one step) to the initial conditions (of the next step), but outside of
          those blocks of steps (by default in all steps) the optimization is
          free to choose initial conditions such as Generator Initial Generation , Initial Units
            Generating , etc .
