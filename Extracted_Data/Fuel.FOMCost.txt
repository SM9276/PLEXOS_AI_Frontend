Paragraphs:
Fuel FO&M Cost is the total fixed operations and maintenance cost incurred by use of the fuel, as defined by the F&OM Charge .

When the Production Unit Commitment Optimality is Integer, the Fuel O&M costs will be formulated with integers in the LP therefore if any fuel is used in the year, the Fixed O&M Cost will be 100% of the Fixed O&M Charge. When the Commitment Optimality is not Integer, the Fixed O&M Cost will be allocated based upon the number of periods in the year that the fuel is used.
