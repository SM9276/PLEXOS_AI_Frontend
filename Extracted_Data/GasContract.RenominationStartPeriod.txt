Description:	User defined renomination windows for Base Gas Contracts

Paragraphs:
By default, Base Gas Contracts renominate on a calendar month basis (subject to the Min Days Between Renomination and Max Renomination inputs). Gas Contract Renomination Start Period is used to override the default renomination window with a user defined window.

The interval where the user specifies Is a Start Period, indicates the start of a new window. Default value is Not a Start Period. So the user only needs to specify the starts of the windows.
In below example, Base Contract windows are 1st day of Jan, Apr, May, Aug of 2020.
