Paragraphs:
Vehicle Charging reports the
          charging rate in kilowatt-hours for interval reporting, or total
          energy in the reporting period in megawatt-hours for summary
          reporting. This value is the load on the Charging
            Station . The energy that reaches the battery is net of charging
          losses as implied by the Charge
            Efficiency . For example if Charging is 2 kW and Charge
          Efficiency is 98% the Charging Station sees a load of 2 kW and the
          battery receives 2 x 0.98 = 1.96 kWh of Energy in a one-hour period.

The price paid and total cost of electricity used in charging are
          reported as Charge Price and Charge Cost respectively.
