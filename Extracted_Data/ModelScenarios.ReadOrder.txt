Paragraphs:
Model Scenarios Read Order sets the order in which Scenario data are read into the simulation. The data are read in ascending order with later-read values overwriting earlier-read values. Thus scenarios with a higher read order value take precedence over those with a lower read order value.

The default order is alphabetical on scenario name.
