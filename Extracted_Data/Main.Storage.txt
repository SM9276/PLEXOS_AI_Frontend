Description:	Storage reservoir, head-pond, or tail-pond

See also Storage
              Property Reference for a detailed list of properties for this
            class of object.

Storage objects are used to represent hydro storage reservoirs with
          short, medium, or long-term storage, generator head-ponds and
          tail-ponds, or even simple junctions in a river-chain. A Storage may
          connects to one or more Waterway and/or Generator objects to create
          a model of a river chain.

In general there are four main types of storage:

There are several options for the units of storage, for both metric
          and Imperial US, and this is controlled by the Hydro
            Model database setting.

Deterministic, Monte Carlo, and multi-stage stochastic optimization
          with Rolling Horizon (RH) and/or Stochastic
            Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) methods is supported.
