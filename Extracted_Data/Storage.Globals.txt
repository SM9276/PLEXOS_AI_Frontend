Header: Storage Globals

Table Details:
Required Members:	0
Maximum Members:	unbounded
Description:	set of Globals defining data for the Storage

Paragraphs:
Storage Globals is used to define an external Future Cost Function as input to the model. The storage in this membership are used in the future cost formulation.

Users can define multiple future cost linear equations for the same period of time. The slopes for a particular equation corresponds to the water values calculated when the associated storage in this membership reaches that end volume.

External Future Cost Functions are used to define a border condition for large storages so they can be optimized in shorter simulation steps.
