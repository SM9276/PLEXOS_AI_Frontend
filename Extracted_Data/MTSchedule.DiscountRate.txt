Paragraphs:
Discount Rate is used to translate costs incurred in future periods to present day value. Discount Rate is always an annual rate though the granularity of present value calculations can be controlled by the Discount Period Type property.

The discount rate should be entered as a percentage not a decimal. For example if you want a discount rate of 8%, enter the number 8, not 0.08.
