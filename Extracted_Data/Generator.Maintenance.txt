Key Property:	No
Description:	Capacity lost to maintenance

Paragraphs:
As an input, Maintenance sets the amount of generation capacity
              on maintenance outage. This can be defined using a Variable or passed as an input from an Interleaved simulation to coordinate maintenance outages between models.

The definition of the Maintenance output varies by simulation
              phase:

Generator Maintenance reports
                the de-rating applied to capacity to account for Maintenance
                  Rate :

Maintenance = ∑ ( b ) ( Maintenance
                  Rate b × ( Max
                  Capacity - Outage
                  Rating b

where:

b indexes the bands of Maintenance
                  Rate

Generator Maintenance is the
                sum of the user-defined maintenance and the 'idealized'
                maintenance profile:

Maintenance = Discrete
                  Maintenance + Distributed
                  Maintenance

Generator Maintenance reports
                the megawatt capacity on maintenance from the realized
                maintenance events (combination of user-defined and those
                generated by PASA . Thus for any
                given event:

Maintenance->( Max
                  Capacity - Outage
                  Rating ) × Units Out

Note that if MT Schedule Chronology = "Partial"
                then multiple discrete events may combine together in any given
                period as a function of the slicing of the load duration curves
                and thus this profile may then resemble a sculpted de-rating
                rather than discrete events.
