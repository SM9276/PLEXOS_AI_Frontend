Header: LT Plan Solution Quality

Table Details:
Units:	%
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Between 0 And 100
Description:	Continue producing solutions up to Solution Count or when Solution Quality falls to this level

Paragraphs:
This option is supplementary to Solution Count . It sets a limit on the quality of solutions in the Solution Hierarchy, terminating the solution search when this quality measure it reached. To measure the quality of solution ( i ) relative to the optimal solution ( i = 0) the following formula is used:

The following is an example of the output of the solution hierarchy algorithm showing the solution number, objective value and quality measure. The Solution Quality is set to 98%:
