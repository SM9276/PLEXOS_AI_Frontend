Description:	Coefficient of the Decision Variable in the Gas Plant Energy Usage definition equation

Paragraphs:
Gas Plant Decision
            Variables Energy Usage Definition Coefficient is the coefficient
          of the Decision Variable in the GasPlant Energy Usage definition
          equation.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) and the Gas
            Plant value by x j , the following term is
          added to the formulation:

Thus a positive value of a (i,j) increases Energy
            Usage of the Plant and vice
          versa.
