Header: Stochastic Brazil Scenario Tree

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	Flag if the PARMA scenario tree is created with non-equiprobability

Paragraphs:
This option applies when the PARMA
           Model Type is set to "PARMA". When creating the scenario tree, prediction is performed on each stage when a node on a full branch starts branching. 
           In the default method, the values of all children nodes are predicted within an equiprobable sample space and balanced with the full branch node at the central. 
           When Brazil Scenario Tree is set as True, it first generates a larger set of N (N = 1000, for example) equiprobable samples, and 
           then reduces the samples resulting in a smaller set of non-equiprobable scenarios, and assigns them to the full and hanging child nodes.
