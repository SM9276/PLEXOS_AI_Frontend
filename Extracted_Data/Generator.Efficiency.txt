Description:	Efficiency of generation

Paragraphs:
Generator Efficiency is the efficiency of generation.

Thermal and hydro generators use a different definition for this property. For thermal generators efficiency is defined as:

where:

and for hydro generators, i.e those connected to a Head Storage , the definition is similar to the input property Efficiency Incr :

Again the units of this property depend on the unit system and Storage Model being used e.g. for metric volume the unit is MW/cumec, and for US Imperial volume the unit is MW/AF/hr.
