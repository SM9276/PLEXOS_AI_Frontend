Paragraphs:
Interface Constraints Expansion Cost Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of total Interface Expansion
            Cost from the start of the horizon up to the current period in
          the constraint. The cost is the nominal lump-sum Build
            Cost i.e without any adjustment for Discount
            Rate .

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation.
