Description:	Charging Station <name> defines [Deferrable Load] but no simple [Fixed Load] Vehicles are connected.

Paragraphs:
Deferrable load represents potential deviations from prescribed charging profiles which are defined prior to
                simulation commencement. Deferment should therefore be used in conjunction with simple Vehicle models (which define Fixed Load ). Non-simple
                (i.e. detailed) vehicle models allow charging to occur at times and quantities that minimise total system cost: deferment
                is redundant when charging is cooptimised in this way. See Vehicle for
                a comparison of simple and detailed vehicle models.
