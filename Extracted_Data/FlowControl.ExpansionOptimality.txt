Description:	Expansion planning integerization scheme.

Paragraphs:
Flow Control Expansion Optimality controls the integerization of flow control build decisions in LT Plan . 
		  This flag is only applicable when the LT Plan Optimality is Integer. When LT Plan Optimality is Linear then all builds are linear.
		  It can take the following values:

NOTE: The option Optimality controls the linear/integer decision at the global level. You can also choose to integerize only part of the horizon using the switch Integerization Horizon .
