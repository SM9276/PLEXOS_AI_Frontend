Description:	If the final deterministic pass is run after iterations of the Rolling Horizon algorithm

Paragraphs:
This setting toggles on/off the final deterministic pass of a
          stochastic optimization solved with Rolling
            Horizon . By default, after the stochastic rolling iterations are
          complete a final deterministic (Monte Carlo) pass is performed across
          each of the full branches (scenarios) with storage trajectories
          following the stochastic optimal solution(s). This is the solution
          output to the solution file.

You may want to disable this final pass if the only output you need
          from the Rolling Horizon is the Future
            Cost Function . For example, your Rolling Horizon model might run
          with a reduced set of full branches (scenarios) to produce the
          operational policy. You can then apply that policy in a simulation
          with more scenarios.

Note that you can control the time horizon of the deterministic pass
          using the input Horizon Look-ahead
            Count , for example if you want to run extra years to establish
          the optimal policy but discard those years in reporting.
