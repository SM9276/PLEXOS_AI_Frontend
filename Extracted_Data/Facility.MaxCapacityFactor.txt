Paragraphs:
Facility Max
            Capacity Factor (and its period-specific variants ( Hour , Day , Week , Month and Year )
          define an upper bound on a facility' capacity
            factor on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis.

A straight-forward approach to modelling an production-limited
          Facility ( e.g. a hydro generator) is to place periodic limits
          on the capacity factor as in Table 1

Note the use Capacity
            Factor Month variant and time
            slices (patterns) to change the capacity factor limits by month
          of year.

The simulator converts these constraints into Constraint objects. By default the constraints are 'hard' i.e. no violation is allowed. If you prefer to allow violations then set
          the Max Production
            Penalty property.
