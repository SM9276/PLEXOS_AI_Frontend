Description:	Shadow price (marginal cost) of emissions

Paragraphs:
Emission Shadow Price as an input is the incremental cost of the Emission that appears in the simulation objective function as a pseudo-cost.

As an output it is the dual variable value associated with the emission production definition constraint. As such it represents the marginal cost to the system of the last/next unit of Emission Production . This price will reflect both input Shadow Price and/or the price of any binding Emission constraints e.g. defined using Max Production .
