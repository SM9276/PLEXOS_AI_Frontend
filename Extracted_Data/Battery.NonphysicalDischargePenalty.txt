Header: Battery Non-physical Discharge Penalty

Table Details:
Units:	$/MW
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	-1
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Penalty applied to non-physical discharging of the battery. A value of -1 means none is allowed.

Paragraphs:
Battery Non-physical Discharge Penalty is the penalty applied to non-physical discharging of the battery. Non-physical discharging is
                analogous to Dump Energy : energy reducing SoC but not appearing elewhere in the system (i.e. servicing load through Generation , Self Discharge etc.). A value of -1 means none is allowed. Other values cause non-physical discharging variables to be formulated, priced at the supplied value.

Non-physical charge and discharge penalties do not represent physical system capability. They are primarily diagnostic tools (i.e. diagnosis and correction of infeasibilities).

If Unserved Energy is allowed , non-physical penalties should
                be priced above the cost of USE ( VoLL ). A value of 10x VoLL is a useful starting point.

Non-physical charging and discharging is reported in Battery Non-physical Charge Adjustments and Battery Non-physical Discharge Adjustments respectively.
