Paragraphs:
Constraint Unit Commitment Mode
          controls how the constraint is handled during unit commitment. The
          setting can take one of these values:

This setting is useful in reducing the complexity of the model being
          solved during unit commitment e.g. you may wish to relax
          some transmission, reserve, emission or other types of constraints
          during unit commitment and only enforce them once the commitment is
          decided.
