Table Details:
Units:	MJ
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Description:	Energy per unit of the Commodity

Paragraphs:
Commodity Energy Density is in
          megajoules (MJ) per unit of the Commodity. This is required for
          commodities that are not natural energy units but are involved in a Process that converts to/from energy
          units.

For example, if you want the simulator to automatically convert
          litres of liquid fuel to kilowatt-hours via one or more Process objects or when consumed by a Vehicle then setting the Energy Density will allow that conversion to be
          automatic.
