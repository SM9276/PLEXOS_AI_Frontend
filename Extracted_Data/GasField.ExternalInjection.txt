Paragraphs:
Gas Field External Injection is an external injection of gas into the field. This value can be positive (representing addition of gas to the field from external source) or negative (representing some loss of gas from the field).
It is important to note that External Injection represents a discrete quantity of gas not a rate, hence you should define the property dynamically as in the following example:
