Paragraphs:
Generator Min Load Penalty is the
          penalty for violating the Min Load constraint. Non-negative values make the Min
            Load constraint 'soft' with each megawatt-hour that Generation is below the Min Load priced at
          this value in the objective function. The default value of -1
          indicates a 'hard' constraint. The constraint activity (amount of Generation applied to the
          constraint) is reported in the property Min
            Load Generation , and violations are reported in the properties Min Load Violation , Min
            Load Violation Cost and Min
            Load Violation Hours .
