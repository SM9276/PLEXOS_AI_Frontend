Paragraphs:
By default generating units are assumed to run up instantaneously. To override this behaviour Heat Plant Run Up Rate defines a ramping limit that applies while the generating unit is running up from zero to Min Stable Level . This property is a simplified version of Start Profile and is used when the run up rate is constant for any given cooling state.

Note that this run up rate can be different to the Max Ramp Up which applies in the normal operating range, and Max Ramp Up does not need to be defined to use Run Up Rate.

Example:

Run Up Rate is a multi-band property where each band corresponds to a cooling state. Cooling states are defined using multi-band Start Cost and Start Cost Time . In the following example the unit is 'hot' when it has been shutdown for less than six hours and can run up at a rate of 0.75 GJ/hr. slowing to 0.5 GJ/hr. if the unit has been shutdown for longer than six hours.
