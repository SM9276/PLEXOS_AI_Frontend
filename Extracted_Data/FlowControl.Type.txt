Normal Phase-Shifting Transformer

Distributed Series Reactor (DSR) is a saturable reactor, and therefore the maximum inductance of a fleet of units is current-dependent. The angle-flow curve is modeled by using Angle Points and Flow Loading Points .

Distributed Static Series Compensator (DSSC) is modelled as an AC voltage source in series with any given line. The voltage injected is fully variable within certain bounds.

Mechanically-Switched Series Reactor (MSSR) is able to inject discrete levels of inductance to achieve angle shifting between 0 and Max Angle .

Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) is modeled as a current-dependent impedance that can be inductive or capacitive.

Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) is modeled as a variable series voltage source, with allowable angle ranging from Min Angle to Max Angle . Typically only one unit installed per line
