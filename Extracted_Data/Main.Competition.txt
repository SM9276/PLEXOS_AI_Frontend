See also Competition Property
            Reference for a detailed list of properties for this class of
          object.

The Competition class groups together settings related to models of
          non-marginal cost and competitive bidding. To apply a Competition
          object to your Model add it to the Model's
            Competition collection. Note that associating the object with a Model defines the global settings, but
          you can optionally associate it with individual simulation phases e.g. LT Plan to run different settings in
          different phases of your simulation.

The simulator is capable of calculating Generator mark-ups statically e.g. to
          recover generator no-load cost or dynamically i.e. accounting for generator availability, transmission congestion as well
          as portfolio effects such as ownership with the Company class and contracts with the Financial
            Contract class.

Static mark-ups can be calculated automatically to recover no-load
          cost with the No Load
            Cost Mark-up setting.

Four dynamic mark-up methods are described in the following articles:

NOTE: The LRMC Recovery method can be used in conjunction with LT
            Plan to simulate market-based pricing outcomes resulting from
          recovery of expansion costs.
