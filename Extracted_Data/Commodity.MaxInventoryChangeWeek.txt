Paragraphs:
Commodity Max Injection Change
          creates a Constraint object that
          limits the change in Closing
            Inventory of the Commodity from one week to the next. By default
          this is a 'hard' constraint. To create a soft constraint, set the Max Inventory Change
            Penalty property. Note that the change in the first period is
          relative to the Opening
            Inventory .
