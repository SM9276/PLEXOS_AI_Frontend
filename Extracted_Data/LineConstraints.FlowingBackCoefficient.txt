Paragraphs:
Line Constraints Flowing Back Coefficient is the coefficient on the binary variable
          indicating if the line is flowing in the counter-reference direction.
          The binary is 1 if the line is flowing in the counter-reference
          direction, 0 otherwise. With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following term is added to the formulation:
