Description:	Allowable minimum state of charge
Battery1	Max Capacity	25	GWh
Battery1	Min SoC	10	%

Paragraphs:
Battery Min SoC is the allowable minimum state of charge of a BESS.  This is expressed as a percentage of the commissioned Capacity (i.e. before any Capacity Degradation ).

Example:

The minimum state of charge that this BESS could obtain is 10% of 25 GWh , which is 2.5 GWh .
