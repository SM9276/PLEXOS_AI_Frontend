Paragraphs:
Facility Min Up Time is the
          minimum number of hours the unit must be 'on' in any commitment cycle.
          Note that Min Up Time (MUT) is a static property. The number of
          hours up is reported in the property Hours
            Up . If it is defined dynamically (varying according to different
          periods), the maximum value will be used. If dynamic MUT is desired,
          it can be achieve using a custom constraints as show in the Min
            Down Time topic.
