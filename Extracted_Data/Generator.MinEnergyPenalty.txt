Description:	Penalty applied to violations of [Min Energy] and [Min Capacity Factor] constraints.

Paragraphs:
Generator Min
          Energy Penalty is the penalty applied to violations of the Min
            Energy or Min
            Capacity Factor constraints and its period-specific variants.
          The penalty is per gigawatt-hour hence the default implies a penalty
          per megawatt-hour of $10000. A value of -1 makes this a hard
          constraint.

If the Penalty is set to 0, PLEXOS will interpret the input for Min Energy Hour/Day/... as 0. 
		 Consequently, all penalties and violations will be calculated assuming a RHS (right-hand side) value of 0 for the Min Energy constraints.
