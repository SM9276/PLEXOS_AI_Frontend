Description:	Price for violating non-anticipativity constraints in scenario-wise decomposition mode

Paragraphs:
Interface Flow Non-anticipativity applies when the Stochastic Method is set to "Scenario-wise Decomposition". It is used to identify the non-anticipative Interface flow decisions i.e. flows whose values must be determined in stage one of the two-stage stochastic optimization. This must be set in combination with Flow Non-anticipativity Time . The property can take any value, but there are two special cases to consider:

Any positive value then acts as a penalty on anticipating the values of the uncertain inputs. It is a useful feature that the non-anticipativity can be relaxed over time as in the following example:
