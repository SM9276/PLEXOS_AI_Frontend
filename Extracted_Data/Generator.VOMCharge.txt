Paragraphs:
Generator VO&M Charge is a
          component of the incremental cost of generation (per megawatt hour),
          and is used to recover maintenance costs that are a direct function of
          generation e.g. wear and tear and other regular equipment
          replacement and servicing costs.

This is a component of a units short-run marginal cost ( SRMC )
          and thus directly affects the price at which the generator's output is
          offered into the market.

The variable operations and maintenance cost associated with the Generation is reported in the
          property VO&M Cost and is
          part of the Generation Cost.
