Paragraphs:
Commodity Decomposition Bound
          Penalty is the penalty applied to violation of inventory limits when
          the Decomposition Method implies possible violations. This occurs when MT
            Schedule uses a resolution coarser than is required to balance
          the inventory each ST Schedule step. For example if MT Schedule is using monthly partial chronology, but ST
            Schedule is defined with daily or weekly optimization steps,
          there is the possibility that Decomposition
            Method = "Targets" will produce targets outside the limits, and
          so this penalty is required to allow such violations for feasibility.
