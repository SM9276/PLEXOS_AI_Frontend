Paragraphs:
Battery Units is the number of BESS units installed.

In a BESS system the Units property directly affects the Capacity and Max Power properties.  Each unit built acts as an incremental increase in these property values.

Example:

This would result in a battery energy storage system that has a total Capacity of 4 MWh and a Max Power output of 20 MW.
