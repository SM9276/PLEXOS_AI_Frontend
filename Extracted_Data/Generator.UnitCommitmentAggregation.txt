Paragraphs:
Generator Unit Commitment
          Aggregation applies to generators with Units > 1 and indicates if the units should be aggregated into an
          equivalent single unit for the purpose of unit commitment. Aggregating
          to a single unit can improve the solve time for the unit commitment
          problem. The automatically-aggregated unit will have capacity equal to
          the sum of the station capacity ( Units x Max Capacity ) and a Min
            Stable Level equal to that of one unit.
