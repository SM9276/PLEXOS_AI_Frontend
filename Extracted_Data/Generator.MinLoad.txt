Paragraphs:
Generator Min Load sets a lower
          bound on the Generation from the facility in each dispatch interval
          regardless of the unit commitment.

How the value of Min Load is interpreted depends on the Min
            Load Global setting. It controls whether the value is across all
          units at the facility or unit-by-unit.

By default Min Load is a hard constraint, but can be made a soft
          constraint by defining Min
            Load Penalty and any violations are reported in the properties Min Load Violation , Min
            Load Violation Cost and Min
            Load Violation Hours .

For the example in Table 1 the Min Load is a time series read from a Data File .

The amount of Generation attributable to the Min Load requirement is reported as Min
            Load Generation .

Note that Min Load is automatically derated by the Generator Forced Outage Rate and Maintenance Rate in
          non-chronological simulation phases e.g. when LT
            Plan or MT Schedule are
          using load duration curves. This is done to simulate the effect of
          outages on the ability of the station to meet the Min Load
          requirement.
