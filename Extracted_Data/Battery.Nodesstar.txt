Description:	creates copies of the battery at each node in this collection

Paragraphs:
Battery Nodes* is a 'template' feature. Adding Node objects to this collection causes the simulator to create copies of the Battery at each Node . This occurs at runtime and thus allows you to maintain data on a single Battery object but model several objects in the simulation.

All system properties and attributes of the generator are copied e.g. Units , Max Power , Max Units Built , etc .

This template feature is also available for the Purchaser and Generator classes.
                See Purchaser.Nodes* and Generator.Nodes* for further details.
