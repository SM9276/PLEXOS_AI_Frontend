Header: Line Resistance

Table Details:
Units:	pu
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	A measure of the line's opposition to the flow of electric charge

Paragraphs:
Line Resistance is calculated as: Resistance (pu) = Resistance (actual) x MVA Base . It is used to determine the loss in the line: Loss = (Resistance / MVA Base) x (Flow) Â².Note that resistance with negative value will be considered as zero. In addition, if the [Resistance/MVA Base] < 0.000001 , loss will be considered as negligible and will not be modeled for this line.
