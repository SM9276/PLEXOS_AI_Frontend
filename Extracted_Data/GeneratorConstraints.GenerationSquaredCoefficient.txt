Description:	Coefficient of the square of generation

Paragraphs:
Generator Constraints Generation Squared Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient on
          the square of the Generator Generation in the constraint.

This constraint term is intended for use in generic transmission
          constraints where the square of generation forms a part of the limit,
          for example:

Line "A-B" Flow ≤ 1000 + 0.02 x Region "B" Load - 0.0015 x Generator "P" Generation 2

The quadratic term is not directly formulated in the linear
          constraint system, instead the simulator approximates the term by
          solving iteratively along with other dynamic transmission constraints.
          At each iteration, the quadratic term is linearized using a Taylor Expansion around the current Generator Generation level i.e. given the Generation of p ,
          the following terms are added to the Constraint:

... + a (i,j) × 2 × Generator Generation ... {≤,
            ≥, =} b j × - a (i,j) × p 2

This approach includes a linear left hand side term combined with a
          right hand side constant. In the case where the squared term should
          appear exclusively on the right hand side, the preferred approach is
          to define RHS Constant in
          which case the generation level used defaults to the 'last period'
          generation and no active left hand side terms is placed on Generator
          Generation.

NOTE : Constraints including dynamically evaluated
          terms like this cannot be used as Definition constraints for a Decision
            Variable .
