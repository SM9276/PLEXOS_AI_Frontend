Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	â‰¥0
Key Property:	No
Description:	Window of time over which to enforce non-anticipativity constraints in scenario-wise decomposition

Paragraphs:
Storage Trajectory Non-anticipativity Time is the window of time over which End Volume decisions of the Storage are non-anticipative in a stochastic optimization. This property must be used in conjunction with Trajectory Non-anticipativity .
