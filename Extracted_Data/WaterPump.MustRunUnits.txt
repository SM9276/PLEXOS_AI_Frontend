Paragraphs:
Water Pump Must Run Units is the
          number of units at the facility that must be committed in a given period i.e. a lower
          bound on units operating.
          The optimizer is free to commit more than this number of units up to the number of available units.

Note that if you want to have fixed commitment, rather than a minimum
          commitment, then use the Commit property. Please note that if Must Run Units is set equal to Units the property
          is converted to Commit automatically.
