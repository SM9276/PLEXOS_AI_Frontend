Paragraphs:
Generator Effective Forced Outage
          Rate is the Forced Outage
            Rate for use in calculation of reliability
            indices . This overrides the Forced
            Outage Rate used to create outage patterns in the main
          simulation. In addition, you may define the Effective Forced Outage
          Rate but not the Forced
            Outage Rate in the case where a generator should be considered
          unreliable for the purposes of reliability calculations but not in the
          main simulation.

The purpose of this input is to capture aspects such as short-term
          storage that are not considered when the reliability
            indices are calculated. For example, if a small pumped hydro
          generator has only four hours of storage you might set the Effective
          Forced Outage Rate = 2 / hours of storage = 12.5% (Note: This figure
          is illustrative only).
