Paragraphs:
Heat Plant Efficiency Base is the base energy consumption of a heat plant. It describes the base consumption and losses of a heat plant when the plant is on (with or without heat load demand). Heat Production + HeatPlantON *(Efficiency Base) = (Fuel Off-take + 3.6*(Gen Load))*(Efficiency Incr) .See also Efficiency Incr .
