Paragraphs:
Performance Max Monitored MIP
          Iterations sets a limit on the number of iterations of checking and
          enforcing 'monitored' elements i.e those that are not formulated
          'upfront' suchÂ  transmission limits and generic constraints.
          These constraints are enforced in two passes:

This setting limits the number of iterations in that second phase i.e. those with integer constraints enforced. In very large-scale models,
          significant time can be saved by limiting the integer iterations,
          however, the solution might not be fully converged - there might be
          some constraint violations remaining unresolved.
