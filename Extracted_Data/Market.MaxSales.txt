Paragraphs:
Market Max Sales sets an upper
          bound on the amount sold into the market at the given Price in any interval. If you prefer to set a fixed demand from the market
          use the Demand property instead.

Note that when a supply curve is defined using Price and Quantity there is a natural
          upper bound on the sales set by the total quantity less the Base
            Quantity .

Example:

The example in Table 1 is a daily exercisable sell option. Sales are
          made in 25 MW blocks up to 200 MW at a price of $60/ MWh .
          The blocks are taken over the "HLH" timeslice e.g. peak
          periods.
