Paragraphs:
Variable Formulate Value is a flag that indicates if the Value is formulated as a decision variable. 
            All types of variables (i.e. defined solely from Profile , randomly sampled variables, booleans, lookup variables etc.) are supported.

This variable has been exposed, so it can be used in conjunction with the RHS Constant feature.

As described in the Concise Modelling Guide , variables can be referenced with the token prefix 'VarValue_'. The default 1-period 
            lag can also be disabled by appending '{0}'.
