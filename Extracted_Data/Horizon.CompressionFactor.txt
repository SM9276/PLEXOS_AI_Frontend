Description:	Number of intervals to output per interval simulated

Paragraphs:
Horizon Compression Factor reduces
          the resolution used during simulation without reducing the resolution
          of the interval data written to the solution file. For example, if Periods per Day is 48
          (30-minute intervals) and Compression Factor = 4 then the simulation
          will use a two-hour interval length but the solution file will write
          out 30-minute interval data. Therefore, increasing the Compression
          Factor is equivalent to reducing Periods per Day except for the way
          solution data are written and is convenient if you wish to report on
          the 'original' interval length but take advantage of increased
          performance from a lower resolution simulation.

Reducing the resolution used in the simulation can improve
          performance especially for LT Plan models and stochastic models that spend significant time working with
          large numbers of intervals.

Note: [Interval Length] x [Compression Factor] should be equal to another accepted interval length. For example, if the interval length is 30 minutes, then the compression factor cannot be 3 because that would create intervals of length 90 minutes, which is not an accepted interval length.
            Also, if [Interval Length] x [Compression Factor] is greater than an hour, then Hourly reporting is disabled.
