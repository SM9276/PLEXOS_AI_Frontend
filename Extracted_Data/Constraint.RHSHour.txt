Paragraphs:
Constraint RHS Hour defines the right-hand side (constant) term for each hour of the planning horizon. Setting this property defines the period of the constraint as one constraint per hour.

Note: This type of constraint is not be confused with an interval constraint which produces one constraint for every interval. Thus, RHS Hour only applies to sub-hourly models i.e. those where Horizon Periods per Day is greater than 24.
