Header: Production Fuel Use Function Precision

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	≥0
Description:	Precision for calculation of linear approximation to fuel function.

Paragraphs:
Production Fuel Use Function Precision sets a tolerance when fitting a step function to a generators marginal heat rate function . Steps (tranches) are added until the tolerance is met or the Max Heat Rate Tranches is hit.

Refer to the article Heat Rate Modelling for more details.
