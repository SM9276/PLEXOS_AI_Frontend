Paragraphs:
Facility Constraints Hours Down Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient of the number
          of hours the units at the facility have been off referenced to the
          beginning of the simulation interval i.e. the numbers of
          hours since the unit last shut
            down . For the first interval of the Horizon this is determined by Initial
            Hours Down .

For the example in Table 1 the facility " S1C _GT1"
          cannot start until facility " GT1 " has
          been off for four hours.

This coefficient can be applied to single- unit or multi-unit facilities. In the latter case, Hours Down Coefficient
          is the number of hours the whole multi-unit facility has been shut
          down.
