Build Set Size	50	-	1	

Paragraphs:
Setting Facility Build Set Size to
          a non-zero value indicates that expansion must occur in sets of this
          many units.

In this example the Facility is
          defined as 1 unit in size that must be built in sets of 50 at a time.
          Thus 0, 50, 100, 150 only is feasible for Units
            Built .

Note that this set size constraint is ignored if Expansion
            Optimality is "Linear Relaxation" or in years outside the LT
            Plan Integerization
            Horizon .
