Header: Process Primary Input Conversion Factor

Table Details:
Units:	-
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	1
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Primary Input units per unit of Primary Output

Paragraphs:
Process Primary
            Input Conversion Factor translates the primary input Commodity to equivalent units of the Primary
            Output .Â  This factor is only required if the Commodity Unit types do not automatically
          convert and/or the Energy
            Density is not defined (for conversion to/from energy and
          non-energy units).

NOTE: The simulator will issue a warning if it cannot automatically
          determine the conversion factor between units.
