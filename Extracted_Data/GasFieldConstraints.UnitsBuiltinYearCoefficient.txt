Paragraphs:
Gas Field Constraints Units Built in Year Coefficient is the left-hand side coefficient in
          the constraint of the binary (0,1) variable indicating if the Gas
            Field is built in the year.

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:
