Paragraphs:
This article describes the input and solution database schema for PLEXOS. Both XML and MicrosoftÂ® Access .MDB file formats implement the same schema.

PLEXOS input databases describes two layers:

The Master Layer describes and defines rules for the input of data in the Data Layer. It builds the data model and rules in the following sequence

Classes are types of objects e.g. Generator is a class, so is Fuel. Collections are unique combinations of classes (two only) e.g. the collection Generator.Fuels lists the fuels used by each generator.

In addition to these 'core' tables The database schema defines primary keys and referential integrity rules that must be followed. These ensure that:

Thus the input database schema is completely self-contained and self-checking and it is impossible to orphan data. Figure 1 illustrates the database schema for PLEXOS Version 5.x through 6.x. This schema is very close to first-normal, meaning that there is no repetition of data, except as is required to enforce appropriate referential integrity rules. The structure is highly compact, making use of numeric keys wherever possible and storing string names of elements only once. In fact all keys and joins are made with integers. Every user element (objects, memberships, data) are tagged with unique integer keys. These keys are self-generating (auto-numbers). The tables in the schema are described in the following table:

The schema for the solution database files is shown in Figure 2 and described in the following table.

Please see the following page for information about interacting with PLEXOS databases and Solution files using the dataset to SQL Utility .
Lists:
	- Invalid combinations of objects cannot be created in memberships
	- No duplicate definitions exist for objects or memberships
	- Deleting objects results in cascaded deletions of memberships and properties
