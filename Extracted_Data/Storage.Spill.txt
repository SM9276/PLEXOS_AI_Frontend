Paragraphs:
Storage Spill is the amount of
          spill out of the storage. It is the sum of flows down Exporting
            Waterways that flow "to the sea" and spills directly from the Storage as allowed by the Max
            Spill property.

Although Spill generally only occurs when the Storage reaches the Max Volume in a
          cascading hydro network it can be economic to 'spill' water even when
          the Storage is not full. These
          'economic' spills can be prevented using the Waterway Flow Control property.
