Description:	Scalar for future cost function objective and constraint terms

Paragraphs:
FCF Scalar is a scalar for the future cost function objective and
          constraint terms in the SDDP algorithm. Scaling affects the numerical stability of the linear
          programming problems. It is good practice to experiment with the FCF
          Scalar to find a value that provides the most stable convergence for
          the given problem.

As a rough guide, if the total objective function value of your
          simulation is in the order 1E+9 then an FCF Scalar of 1E+6 might work
          well. If the objective is in the order 1E+10 then values up to 1E+7
          might be better. Note that the scalar does not need to be a perfect
          power of 10 e.g. you can set a value of 5E+6.
