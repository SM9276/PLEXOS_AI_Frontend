Paragraphs:
Flow Path Service Factor is the
          proportion of Installed
            Capacity that is available i.e. not on outage, and
          defined as:

Service Factor = 100 x ( Installed
            Capacity - Maintenance - Forced Outages ) / Installed
            Capacity

Note the definition allows for partial outages therefore the Service
          Factor can be fractional.
