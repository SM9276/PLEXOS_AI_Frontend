Paragraphs:
Competition No-load Cost Mark-up is a flag that indicates if generator mark-ups should be automatically set such that no-load cost is recovered.

Example

Consider a Generator with the following capacity and heat rate properties:

Assuming a Fuel Cost of 2.0 then we have the following:

In this table:

Note that mark-up is only ever positive, and full recovery only occurs when the offer band is fully dispatched. Note further that in the multi-band case, the final offer prices might not be monotonically non-decreasing. If this is the case, integer decision variables are automatically introduced to enforce clearing of the offer bands in physical order.

The no-load cost mark-up is included in the reported properties Generator Mark-up and Offer Price .

Please refer to the article Heat Rate Modelling for an explanation of no-load cost.
Lists:
	- Generation is the megawatt production level
	- Band Quantity is the size of the offer band between the given load points
	- Heat Rate Incr is the incremental heat rate in the offer band
	- Fuel Offtake (Heat Rate Base + ∑ Heat Rate Incr b × Band Quantity b ) is the total fuel consumed when the unit is loaded to the top of the offer band
	- Fuel Cost (Fuel Offtake × Fuel Price) is the total cost
	- Marginal Cost (Heat Rate Incr × Fuel Price) is the incremental cost of production in the offer band
	- Average Cost (Fuel Cost / Generation) is the average cost of production
	- Spot Revenue (Marginal Cost &times Generation) is the revenue that would be paid to the generator based on its marginal cost in the offer band
	- Loss (Fuel Cost - Spot Revenue) is the loss (positive) or gain (negative)
	- Mark-up Required (Loss/Generation) is the mark-up (positive) or mark-down (negative) required for the generator to break even when the generator is loaded to the top of the offer band
	- Offer Price (Marginal Cost + MAX(0, Mark-up Required)) is the final offer price in the band
