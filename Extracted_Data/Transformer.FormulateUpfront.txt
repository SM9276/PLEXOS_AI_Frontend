Header: Transformer Formulate Upfront

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Key Property:	No
Description:	If constraints should all be formulated upfront rather than checked iteratively.

Paragraphs:
Transformer Formulate Upfront controls when the thermal limits for the Transformer are added to the mathematical programming problem. The setting can take these values:

In general it is more efficient to add constraints only as needed but in some cases performance maybe improved by adding the constraints upfront, avoiding additional iterations.
