Paragraphs:
Generator Offers Must Clear in Order controls how non-monotonic generator offers are cleared. By default (value = 0), generator offers are cleared from lowest to highest priced regardless of the band numbering. Setting this property to true (-1) PLEXOS adds integer constraints to the simulation to ensure that offers are always cleared in band order.

Example:

Here the generator offers in four bands. The price in band four is lower than in band three. By default band four would clear before band three, but enabling this option will force band three to clear before band four.

Note that this option applies only when you define the offers for the generator. If the no offer is defined the generator's cost model is based on heat rate. The property Production Heat Rate Error Method controls how PLEXOS handles non-convex heat rate functions .
