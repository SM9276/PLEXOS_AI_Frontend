Header: PASA Reliability Criterion

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	In (0,1)
Description:	Criterion used to select periods for Monte Carlo reliability analysis

Paragraphs:
This PASA option relates to the MT
            Schedule Reliability Chronology feature. Periods
          are selected for Monte Carlo simulation in MT
            Schedule based on this setting. Specifically, the statistic is
          computed for each period (where the period is controlled by PASA Step Type ) and the periods ranked.
          The top Reliability Max
            Sample s periods are then selected for Monte Carlo simulation.
          The statistic used to rank periods is controlled by this option and
          can take one the following values:

Note that only objects selected for reporting are included in the
          statistic used to select periods i.e. you can limit the scope
          of the analysis by adding a filter to the Lists collection of the Report object
          associated with the running Model . For
          example. you might want the reliability analysis to apply only to a
          single Region , Zone or Node .
