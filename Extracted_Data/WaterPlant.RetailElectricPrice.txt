Description:	Retail price of electric power used by the water plant

Paragraphs:
Water Plant Retail Electric Price is the retail price of electric power used by the water plant. 
            When this is populated and the water plant is connected to an electric node, PLEXOS will use a two-pass solution. In the first pass 
            this retail price is included in the optimization as a multiplier on the electricity delivered to the water plant. In the second pass, 
            this price is reduced by the shadow price of the electric node from the first pass.
