Paragraphs:
Water Pump Units is the number of installed units. 
          This can simply indicate the existence (1) or not (0) of a single unit, or the presence of multiple units. 
          For multi-unit facilities the units are treated identically and properties apply to each unit thus there 
          is no need to adjust other properties on the pump when the number of units changes. 
          The number of units can change via input at any time during the simulation horizon and there is no limit to the number of units. See also: Water Pump Units Operating
