Paragraphs:
How the price at a node (transmission bus) is calculated depends on the OPF Algorithm selected. In the standard OPF the nodal price is a direct output of the optimization and are equal to the shadow price (dual variable) on the net injection constraint at the node. In the large-scale OPF nodal price is not directly available and instead is computed from the system lambda and constraint shadow prices modified by the shift factors.
