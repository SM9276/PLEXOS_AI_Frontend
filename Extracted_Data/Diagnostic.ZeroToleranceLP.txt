Description:	Generic writer zero value tolerance for LP file writing

Paragraphs:
This option is used with the Generic Writer .  By default the tolerance setting is zero, which means the Generic Writer produces LP files without modifying any values.  However, when this is set to a non-zero number, say 1, the Generic Writer will set all coefficients that are less than equal to 1 to zero.
