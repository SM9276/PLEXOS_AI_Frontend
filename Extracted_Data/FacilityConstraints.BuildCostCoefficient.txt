Description:	Coefficient of total build cost

Paragraphs:
Facility Constraints Build Cost is the left-hand side coefficient of Facility Build Cost from the start of the
          horizon up to the current period in the constraint. The cost is the
          nominal lump-sum Build Cost i.e without any adjustment for Discount
            Rate .

With the coefficient represented by a (i,j) the following
          term is added to the formulation:

... + a (i,j) × ∑ ( t = 1, k ) Facility Build
            Cost × Facility Units
            Built t ... {≤,
            ≥, =} b j

where: k is the current period e.g. year of the simulation.
