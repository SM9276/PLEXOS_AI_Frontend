Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0
Validation Rule:	In (0,1)
Description:	Method for handling start costs in the mathematical formulation (integrate into the formulation, or calculate ex-post)

Paragraphs:
Production Start Cost Method is used to trade-off formulation size (and hence performance) with accuracy in modelling generating unit start costs. It can take these values:

With the default "Optimize" setting, start cost elements are included in the mathematical programming problem formulation for any setting of the Unit Commitment Optimality . Thus this option can improve the performance of any simulation where Start Cost is defined.
