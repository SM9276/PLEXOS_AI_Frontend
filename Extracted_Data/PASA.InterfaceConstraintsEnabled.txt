Header: PASA Interface Constraints Enabled

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	True (-1)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	If transmission interface constraints are enabled in PASA.

Paragraphs:
PASA Interface Constraints Enabled toggles on/off transmission Interface constraints in the reserve sharing formulation. When this option is toggled 'on' the flow of capacity reserves across Lines in the Interfaces is constrained by the flow limits defined on the Interfaces .

See also:

When both options are 'off' the system is treated as a single unconstrained transmission area where reserve capacity can be shared for the objective of leveling reserves over time.
