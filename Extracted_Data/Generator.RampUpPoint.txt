Paragraphs:
Generator Ramp Up Point is a multi-band property that defines the load point for use with multi-band Max Ramp Up constraints. These should be defined with equal number of bands of Max Ramp Up as in the following example. The ramp limit in the band applies up to the point defined in the band.

Example:

Note that the ramp penalty is also multi-band which allows different penalties for different generation levels.
