Description:	Heat production plant

Paragraphs:
See also Heat Plant Property Reference for a detailed list of properties for this class of object.

Heat Plant is a special object that produces heat form burning the fuels , and/or recovers heat from Heat Input Nodes and/or converting electricity to heat. To the electrical network, heat plant is a load source (anti-generator). A Heat Plant connects to the electrical system via the Nodes and the heat system via Heat Output Nodes and/or Heat Input Nodes memberships.

Example: Modelling a Waste Heat Recovery Boiler (WHRB) that recovers waste heat from a Gas Turbine (GT) generator with heat top-up from a gas duct burner or electric boiler. Other special modelling requirements are:
