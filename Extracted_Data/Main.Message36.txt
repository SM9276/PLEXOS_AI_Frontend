Header: Message 36

Table Details:
Severity:	Moderate (value = 3)
Default Action:	Warn (value = 1)
Description:	Generator <name> Fixed Load will override Generator Min Load.

Paragraphs:
Message 36 occurs when you define both Generator Fixed Load and Min Load . Because these properties might be in conflict the simulator takes Fixed Load (the stricter constraint) as defined and ignores Min Load .

To avoid this issue do not define Fixed Load and Min Load on the same Generator . Note that you may use a Scenario to switch between these properties in different Model objects.
