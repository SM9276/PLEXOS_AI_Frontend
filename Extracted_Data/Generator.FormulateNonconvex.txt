Paragraphs:
Generator Formulate Non-convex
          controls when integers are used to enforce clearing of marginal
          efficiency tranches in order. The simulator will detect (but not
          correct) when there is an out of order dispatch of the fuel offtake
          variables an issue a warning. In order to force the order, a set of
          integer variables and constraints are required. This setting can take
          these values:

Settings other than 'Auto' supersede the Heat
            Rate Error Method setting in the Production object.

Potential uses of this setting are:

Non-convex dispatch is usually related to:
