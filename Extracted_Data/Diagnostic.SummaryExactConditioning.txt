Header: Diagnostic Summary Exact Conditioning

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	False (0)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	Report exact basis condition number (if available) in the solver summary.

Paragraphs:
Condition numbers are described in Numerical Stability .

This parameter enables the calculation of exact basis condition numbers which are included in the Solver Summary . This parameter
                 has no effect if solver summaries are disabled.

Exact condition numbers are more computationally expensive than estimated condition numbers (which are included by default Solver Summary ). As for estimated basis condition numbers, exact condition numbers require a basic feasible solution.
                Some problems or Performance settings will not generate a basic feasible solution. One example is Barrier algorithm with Crossover disabled.
