Paragraphs:
Generator Max
            Energy (and its period-specific variants Hour , Day , Week , Month and Year )
          defines an upper bound on the sum of generator Generation across any interval, hour, day, week, month, or year.

A straight-forward approach to modelling an energy-constrained
          generator (e.g. a hydro generator) is to place periodic limits on the
          generator's energy as in Table 1.

Note the use Max Energy
            Month variant and time slices (patterns) to change the energy limits by each month of the year.Note
          the unit of Max Energy is gigawatt-hours not megawatt-hours like Generation .

The simulator converts the energy constraints into Constraint objects. By default the constraints are hard i.e. no
          violation is allowed. If you prefer to allow violations then use the Max Energy Penalty property.
