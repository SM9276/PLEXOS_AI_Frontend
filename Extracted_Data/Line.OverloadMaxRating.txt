Paragraphs:
Line Overload Max Rating sets the emergency rating of the line for the purposes of security-constrained operation. This is the limit used when checking for violations of line thermal limits post-contingency in the Security Constrained Unit Commitment. If this overload rating is not defined then the default Max Flow or Max Rating is used.

In addition, this property can be used to define the maximum flow that a line can reach when modelling loss in Variable Shift OPF and has a limit penalty.
