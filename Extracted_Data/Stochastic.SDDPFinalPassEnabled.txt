Header: Stochastic SDDP Final Pass Enabled

Table Details:
Units:	Yes/No
Default Value:	True (-1)
Validation Rule:	False (0) or True (-1)
Description:	If a final forward pass is run after the optimal policy iterations of the SDDP algorithm

Paragraphs:
This switch toggles on/off the final forward pass of the SDDP algorithm. That pass is used to output results from the algorithm and
          is on by default. You might want to skip running of the final pass if
          the only output of SDDP you need is the Future
            Cost Function .

Note that you can control the time horizon of the final pass using
          the input Horizon Look-ahead
            Count , for example if you want to run extra years to establish
          the optimal policy but discard those years in reporting.
