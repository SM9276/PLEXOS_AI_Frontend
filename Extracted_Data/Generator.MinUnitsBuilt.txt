Paragraphs:
Generator Min Units Built requires
          that a certain number of unit are built by LT
            Plan over the course of the planning horizon. This number must
          be less than or equal to Max
            Units Built .

Note: The Max Units Built property must be defined for expansion candidates, otherwise the LT Plan will build no units by default.

In this example, one unit must be built at some time in the planning
          horizon. Note that you can control the timing of the build using Date
            From on the Max
            Units Built .
