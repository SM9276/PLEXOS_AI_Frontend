Paragraphs:
Commodity Min Production Hour
          creates a Constraint object that
          forces the Production of the
          Commodity each hour. Note that this is the same as setting Min
            Production when Horizon Periods
            per Day is 24, and only applies for sub-hourly resolution
          modeling. By default this is a 'hard' constraint. To create a soft
          constraint, set the Min
            Production Penalty property.
