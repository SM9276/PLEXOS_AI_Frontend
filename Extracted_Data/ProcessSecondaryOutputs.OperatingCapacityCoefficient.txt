Description:	Coefficient in production definition of the capacity of operating units at the Facility

Paragraphs:
Process Secondary
            Output Operating Capacity Coefficient applies to each Facility implementing the process through the Facility Primary Process membership.
          It is the coefficient in the production definition equation of the
          capacity of Units Operating at the Facility . This input can be
          used to define an output Commodity that is a function of the spare capacity of the Facility .

For example, in an electricity production context, the upward
          spinning reserve 'output' of a generation facility is limited by the
          maximum operating level so:

Spinning Reserve Up = Maximum Operating
          Level Ã— Units Operating - Production

In this case Operating Capacity Coefficient is 1.
