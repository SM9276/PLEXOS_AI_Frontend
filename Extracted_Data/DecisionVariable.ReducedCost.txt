Description:	Reduced cost of the generic decision variable

Paragraphs:
Decision Variable Reduced Cost is the reduced cost (or z j - c j ) of the generic decision variable at the optimal solution. This is the amount by which the objective function coefficient would have to decrease before it would be possible for the corresponding variable to assume a positive value in the optimal solution.
