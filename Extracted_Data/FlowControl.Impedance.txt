Units:	pu
Mode:	Output Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	
Validation Rule:	
Key Property:	No
Description:	Equivalent impedance

Paragraphs:
Flow Control Impedance is the equivalent impedance. It is post calculated based on dispatch line flow and flow control flows.

Impedance = - FC Flow * Line Reactance / Line Flow

Please note that the impedance impact for multi- FCs on a line is not linear. The reported impedance for individual flow control is linearly allocated based on dispatched power flow on them.
