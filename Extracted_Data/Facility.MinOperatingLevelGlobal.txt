Description:	If [Min Operating Level/Factor] applies across all units at the Facility or unit-by-unit

Paragraphs:
Facility Min Operating Level
          Global controls how Min
            Operating Level and Min
            Operating Factor should be interpreted. It can take the
          following values:

The Min Operating
                Level or Min
                Operating Factor (whichever is defined) apply to each of the Units individually. Thus when
              the facility is dispatched, the minimum production is: Min
                  Operating Level × Units
                  Operating ; or Min
                  Operating Factor × Max
                  Operating Level × Units
                  Operating

The Min Operating
                Level or Min
                Operating Factor (whichever is defined) apply to total Installed
                Capacity regardless of the number of Units that make up that capacity. Thus when the facility is dispatched,
              the minimum production is: Min
                  Operating Level ; or Min
                  Operating Factor × Installed
                Capacity

Setting Min Operating Level Global to true changes the way the
          simulator models unit commitment. The commitment is 'facility-wide'
          not 'unit-by-unit'. This affects many aspects of the formulation
          including start up and shutdown, ramping constraints and the
          production efficiency function.
