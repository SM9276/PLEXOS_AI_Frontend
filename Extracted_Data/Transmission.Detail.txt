Description:	Level of detail used in transmission modeling

Paragraphs:
Transmission Detail controls the level of detail of the transmission network.

The attribute can take these values:

The full transmission network is modelled to nodal level and the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is computed.

The transmission network is modelled only to the Region level with all resources inside the region connected to a single notional node. Only links between regions are modelled and a transportation algorithm computes the flows.

The transmission network is modelled only to the Zone level with all resources inside the zone connected to a single notional node. Only links between zones are modelled and a transportation algorithm computes flows. Nodes that are not associated with a Zone are included as 'zones' by themselves.
