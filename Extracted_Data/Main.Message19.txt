Header: Message 19

Table Details:
Severity:	Serious (value = 2)
Default Action:	Warn (value = 1)
Description:	Constraint <name> RHS (period type <value>) is too long for ST Schedule. This Constraint needs to be decomposed by turning on MT Schedule.

Paragraphs:
Message 19 occurs in the following circumstances:

For example, you define a Constraint with RHS Week but the steps of ST Schedule only span one day at a time.

For weekly constraints you can consider changing the ST Schedule step size to a week, or for month and year types enable MT Schedule which will resolve the constraint and decompose it for ST Schedule .

Note that some properties such as Generator Max Capacity Factor Month are converted by the simulator into equivalent Constraint objects and hence this message can be raised for those constraints.
