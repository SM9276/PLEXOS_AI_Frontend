Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Penalty for violatiog the Max Volume constraint

Paragraphs:
Storage Max Volume Penalty is the
          penalty for violating the Max Volume constraint. The default value of -1 means the constraint is 'hard' and
          cannot be violated. A value of zero relaxes the constraint and any
          positive values allows violation at a cost. The violation penalty is
          expressed in energy terms ($/MWh), therefore if your Storage Model is not "Energy" you should
          define Downstream
            Efficiency so the penalty can be interpreted in terms of volume
          of water in the optimization.

Violations and cost are reported in the properties Max
            Volume Violation and Max
            Volume Violation Cost .
