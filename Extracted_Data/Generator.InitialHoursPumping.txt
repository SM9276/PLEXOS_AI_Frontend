Paragraphs:
Generator Initial Hours Pumping is used in combination with Min Pump Time and Min Pump Load and is the hours the unit has been in pump mode at time zero. A non-zero value means the unit was pumping immediately before the start of the simulation horizon and those hours will be compared to the Min Pump Time to decide if when pumping is allowed to stop. Note that pumping can be interrupted by forced outage .
