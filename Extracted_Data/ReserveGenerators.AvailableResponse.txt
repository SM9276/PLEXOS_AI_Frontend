Paragraphs:
Reserve Generators Available Response is the maximum amount of the ancillary service that
          could be provided given the current unit commitment ( Units
            Generating ), dispatch ( Generation , Pump Load ) and provisions to other "like-service" mutually-exclusive reserves.

Note that Max Response also sets a limit on the amount of reserve response each generating
          unit can provide to this reserve.

For raise or regulation raise reserves, there is a special case for
          steam turbine units, where it is getting heat input from CT units. Its
          total generation capacity should be limited by the number of CTs committed and the CT units' heat rate values.

ST Available Response = Min(Pmax ST ,
            (âˆ‘(Pmax CT * Units
              Generating CT * (Heat Rate CT - 3.6)) - Heat Load ST )/Heat
            Rate ST ) - Generation ST
