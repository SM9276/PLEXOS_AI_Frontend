Description:	Combined heat and power generation from heat mode

Paragraphs:
CHP Generation is the electrical output from the CHP mode of the generator. It is compute as:

CHP Generation = (1/Ec) * Power-to-Heat Ratio * CHP Heat Production

Where Ec is the energy conversion constant 3.6 [Joules/Wh] (metric) or 3.412 [BTU/Wh] (imperial).
