Header: Vehicle Energy Target Penalty

Table Details:
Units:	$/kWh
Mode:	Input Only
Multi-band:	False
Default Value:	-1
Validation Rule:	Any Value
Key Property:	No
Description:	Penalty for violating the vehicle stored energy target.

Paragraphs:
Vehicle Energy Target Penalty is the penalty per unit of violation of energy storage targets. This property converts
                energy targets constraints from hard to soft constraints.

Vehicle SoC must be formulated for energy targets to be formulated. 
                This property is therefore only valid with detailed Vehicle models (those defining energy storage properties such as Capacity and Efficiency ). Detailed and simple vehicle models are described in Vehicle .
