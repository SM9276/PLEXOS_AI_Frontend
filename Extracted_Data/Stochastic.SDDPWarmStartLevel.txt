Header: Stochastic SDDP Warm Start Level

Table Details:
Units:	-
Default Value:	0.5
Validation Rule:	Between 0 And 1
Description:	The levels to fix the storage in SDDP 'warm start' as a proportion of the distance between minimum and maximum storage levels

Paragraphs:
This option applies when SDDP Warm Start is enabled. The warm start
          level for each stochastic storage (those with Trajectory
          Non-anticipativity set) in the first forward pass of the SDDP
          algorithm is assumed to be:

End
            Volume = SDDP Warm Start Level Ã— ( Max
            Volume - Min Volume ) + Min Volume

Hence the value should be defined between 0 (at minimum) and 1 (at
          maximum).
