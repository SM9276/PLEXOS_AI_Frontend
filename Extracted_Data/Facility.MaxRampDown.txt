Paragraphs:
Facility Max Ramp Down sets a
          limit on the rate at which the facility can decrease Production from one interval to the next. The value is the maximum change in
          production per hour. This limit applies for Production ranges between the minimum
            operating level and Max
            Operating Level .

For multi-unit facilities the available ramp down is defined as:

By default the ramping limit is a hard constraint meaning that no
          violation is allowed. To create soft constraints with a penalty price
          use the Max Ramp Down
            Penalty property.
