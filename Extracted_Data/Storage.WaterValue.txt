Paragraphs:
Storage Water Value is the price of
          water at the end of each simulation step (or end-of-horizon for a
          single step simulation) It can be used as an alternative to setting
          the End Effects Method .
          Water Value defaults to units of $/GWh for the Storage "Potential Energy" Model . When using
          either the "Volume" or "Level" model it is more convenient to use Energy Value ($/MWh) and Energy
            Value Point (GWh) in combination with the conversion factor
          (either automatically calculated or input via Downstream
            Efficiency ) so that the energy value can be converted to native
          volumes of water in storage.

Example:

Here the storage remaining at the end of the step is valued at $45/ MWh .

Given uncertainty in natural
            inflow the Water Value is not constant for all volumes of
          storage. The lower the storage the higher the water value since the
          risk of running short is high. Likewise when the storage nears full
          the water value is low due to the risk of spill. You can define a
          multi-band water value function that discourages release when the
          storage is low and encourages extra release when it is near full. This
          is done using the Water Value or Energy
            Value in combination with Water
            Value Point as in the following example:

The above example defines 10 storage volume bands at various prices
          with higher prices for lower storage volumes leading up to negative
          price for very high volumes. The above example is simplified in that
          the Water Value bands are constant over time. A more realistic
          assumption would be that the values are sculpted over time with high
          penalties for release during periods of low inflow, and vice versa for
          periods of high inflow.
