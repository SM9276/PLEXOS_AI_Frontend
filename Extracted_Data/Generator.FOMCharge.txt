Paragraphs:
Generator FO&M Charge is the
          fixed operations and maintenance charge for each installed unit, and
          forms part of the annual fixed cost charge along with Debt
            Charge and Equity Charge .
          The charge is defined on a per kilowatt-year basis, thus the total
          FO&M Cost for a unit in a year is defined as:

FO&M
            Cost = Installed
            Capacity (MW) x FO&M Charge ($/kW) x 1000
            (kW/MW)

The tax rate is taken into account if Depreciation
            Method is set so that:

FO&M Charge (modeled) =
          FO&M Charge x (1 - Tax Rate )

This charge is combined with the Build
            Cost in the objective function of LT
            Plan . The cost is also relevant for retirement candidates (as an avoidable cost).

Fixed costs are only counted against a generator's Installed
            Capacity i.e. generators with zero Units or zero Units Built do not
          incur fixed costs. The total fixed operations and maintenance cost
          incurred is reported in the FO&M
            Cost property.

The dynamic bidding of generators to recover these fixed costs can be
          modeled in MT Schedule and ST
            Schedule according to the Competition Equilibrium Model setting.
